# Absolute Resonance 

*Heavenly Silkworm Potato* 

## Chapter 1: I Have Three Blank Palaces

The Xia Kingdom. Tianshu Province.
The June sun was blazing, scorching the city of Southwind with its heat.
Many youthful faces could be seen within a bright, spacious training area of the Southwind Academy. The young boys and girls were all dressed in training gear and were seated in the lotus position. They were arranged in a circle, and their gazes were directed towards the center, where two figures were engaged in a rapid-fire duel. Clear ringing sounds could be heard echoing throughout the training area each time their wooden swords clashed.
Both of the duelists were young, roughly fifteen or sixteen years of age. The youth to the right was quite slender and handsome, with a pair of lively eyes and an elegant demeanor. His spectacular leather clothes alone drew the rapt, bashful gazes of quite a few of the maidens present.
“Go, Li Luo!” A particularly brave maiden let out a cheer of support.
Li Luo’s opponent was another youth, but a much more muscular one. His face looked significantly more brutish, and his skin was swarthy and dark. The duel between him and Li Luo almost looked like a battle between a man and a black bear.
When he heard the maiden cheer for Li Luo, he grimaced in a rather jealous manner, then roared out, “Li Luo, I’m not going to hold back any longer!” He took a step forward, causing the floorboard to tremble, then chopped out with his wooden sword towards Li Luo. The sword seemed to screech as it sliced through the air.
Li Luo’s gaze flickered as he saw the shadow of the sword reaching towards him. He suddenly leapt forwards, moving as agilely as a swallow as he sidestepped this fierce, ponderous strike.
“The Windsparrow Step!” someone cried out with a hint of praise. The Windsparrow Step was just a basic resonance art which quite a few of the people present knew, but not many were able to execute it with Li Luo’s level of skill.
Li Luo shot towards the muscular youth like a flying sparrow, then suddenly struck out in a move akin to drawing the sword. A ray of light seemed to flash with incredible speed as his sword pierced towards his opponent’s chest.
“The Lesser Nimblelight Sword!” another called out in surprise. Li Luo’s strike had flashed forward like the curved horns of an antelope, an attack that was both fast and vicious. The onlookers couldn’t help but sigh in praise. The most talented student of the Southwind Academy truly lives up to his reputation!
The look on the muscular youth’s face changed when he saw Li Luo strike at him. However, he was no pushover himself. At this critical moment, he forcefully stabilized himself and then rapidly leapt several steps backwards.
Right at this moment, a faint silvery glow exuded from his hand, seeming to take the form of a blurry silver bear’s palm as he grasped the wooden sword. Accompanying the glow was a faint, deep, bearlike growl that seemed to emanate from somewhere within the muscular youth’s body.
One of the many watching students let out a surprised cry. “That’s Zhao Kuo’s fifth-grade Silver Bear Resonance. It seems he’s really taking this seriously!”
Accompanied by many amazed cries, Zhao Kuo took a step forwards, causing cracks to appear in the floorboards beneath him as he delivered a chopping blow towards Li Luo. His heavy wooden sword was filled with an aura of dominating power and accompanied by an ear-piercing gust of wind, and a rapid silver glow was quickly coalescing atop the sword as well.
“Brutal Chop!” the muscular youth roared out, delivering a brilliant blow directly against the incoming piercing sword-shadow.
Boom! The two swords slammed into each other with such tremendous force that Li Luo’s wooden sword started to crumble into pieces. In the end, the entire wooden sword was blown apart by the forceful, dominating, grizzly-like strike. Faced with this tremendous power, Li Luo was knocked dozens of steps backwards.
After stabilizing himself, Li Luo lowered his head to glance at the remnants of his wooden sword, then let out a helpless chuckle. “Fine, Zhao Kuo. You win.”
“Aww.” This regretful sound simultaneously came from the mouths of multiple maidens as they heard his pronouncement. However, many of the young men watching let out little sniggers of joy. As lusty young men in the prime of their health, they naturally felt quite a bit of jealousy towards Li Luo, due to the amount of affection the young maidens present bore him.
“What a pity! Li Luo’s attack was clearly deadlier. He’s considerably superior to Zhao Kuo when it comes to applying resonance arts. If it wasn’t for the fact that he has yet to awaken a resonance, he definitely would’ve won this duel,” an onlooker evaluated.
“Agreed. Zhao Kuo has a fifth-grade Silver Bear Resonance that grants him astonishing power. In addition, I suspect his resonant power has reached the fifth seal as well. He lives up to his reputation as the strongest member of the Second School.”
“Li Luo is definitely incredibly talented in learning and using resonance arts, but he was born without a resonance of his own. This is an incurable weakness. No matter how skilled you are in applying and using a resonance art, your attacks won’t be of much use if you don’t have sufficiently powerful base of resonant power supporting it.”
“Hah! No need for you to pity him. Think about who Li Luo is! He’s the young lord of House Luolan, one of the four great houses of the Xia Kingdom. His parents, in turn, were the youngest Dukes in the kingdom. In ten short years, their newly established House Luolan quickly ascended to become one of the four great houses. Not only are they famous in the Xia Kingdom, they’ve even earned a reputation beyond our borders!”
“Ugh, all that is ancient history. Three years ago, his parents went missing during the Noble’s War, and ever since then House Luolan has grown much weaker. And, from what I’ve heard, there’s currently a lot of dissent within House Luolan itself. In the future, it might even break apart. I doubt he’ll be the young lord for much longer.”
“Oh? Is that really true? The current leader of House Luolan is Jiang Qing’e, right? One of our senior classmates.”
When this name came out, ardent looks appeared in the eyes of all the young men present. This was because the name Jiang Qing’e had reached mythical status in the annals of the Southwind Academy. Still – when they remembered the special relationship she had with Li Luo, the ardent looks transformed into gazes aimed at Li Luo that were rather odd.
As the young men and women present all whispered and gossiped with each other, Zhao Kuo walked towards Li Luo, then patted him on the shoulder. Smiling, he said, “You alright? Don’t blame me for seizing an unfair advantage.”
Li Luo chuckled. Zhao Kuo was the straightforward sort, and the two of them were usually on quite good terms. The man hadn’t broken any rules either. The fact that he was born with a blank resonance was his greatest weakness; he couldn’t blame Zhao Kuo for that.
A middle-aged man had been watching the two of them from the sidelines for quite some time. Finally, he turned his gaze away. This man’s name was Xu Shanyue, and he was the teacher of the Second School.
Xu Shanyue’s eyes were also filled with a lot of regret. Li Luo truly was an incredibly talented figure, and he was able to learn any resonance art faster than an average person. In this, he had clearly taken after his two incredible parents, and in fact he actually surpassed them. Unfortunately, the fact that he was born with a blank resonance would prove quite problematic for him when it came to improving his resonant power.
When humans trained, they had to rely upon their own resonance and use it as their foundations. They would use their resonances to draw upon the natural energy of the world, then convert it into the force known as power.
There were countless different types of resonances, but most could be roughly divided into one of two camps; elemental resonances and beast resonances.
Elemental resonances referred to the various elements that filled heaven and earth, such as water, fire, wind, or thunder. As for the beast resonances? According to the legends, during the earliest dawn of human civilization, there was an almighty figure that attempted to strengthen humanity by extracting the spirits of countless beasts, then infusing these spirits into the various human bloodlines, giving birth to what was now called ‘beast resonances’. In general, both elemental resonances and beast resonances could be roughly divided into nine different grades. 
Normally, when a human child reached his teens, a cavity known as the ‘resonant palace’ would appear within that child’s body. Once it manifested, it would naturally give birth to that child’s resonance.
Zhao Kuo, for example, had awakened a fifth-grade Silver Bear Resonance within his resonant palace. This obviously was one of the many beast resonances. This resonance specialized in granting tremendous strength, and when combined with his own formidable resonant power, it was capable of unleashing truly destructive levels of power.
And this was where Li Luo’s problem lay. Even though his resonant palace had appeared, no resonance had manifested within the palace. It was completely empty. Cases like this were incredibly rare, and were generally referred to as having a ‘blank resonance’. Since he had no resonance to serve as a foundation for drawing and refining energy from the natural world, it was very difficult for him to gain a high level of resonant power. This was the fundamental reason why he had just been defeated by Zhao Kuo.
He had no resonance within his palace!
The Academy had already performed many different tests to understand why this was the case. His parents were both outstanding figures, after all, and the high-level members of the Academy had very high hopes for him. The had initially believed that in the future, he would definitely be able to gain entrance into the best high-level academy of the Xia Kingdom, the Astral Sage College.
When Li Luo had first entered the Southwind Academy, he had lived up to their expectations, demonstrating an absolutely astonishing aptitude for training in resonance arts. He had been immediately granted entrance into its First School, where all the most talented students of the entire Tianshu Province were gathered.
Alas, as time advanced and as all the students began to manifest their resonances, his current problem had reared its ugly head. By now, he was the only one with a resonant palace but nothing inside it. As a result, although he was always faster to learn new arts than the other students, his resonant power grew at a much slower rate. By now, his resonant power had actually fallen to be below the average for the First Academy.
The whole point of learning resonance arts was to be able to apply your resonant power to greater effect, but if your resonant power was weak to begin with? Well, there was a limit to what even the most profound of resonant arts could achieve.
After subjecting Li Luo to a battery of tests, the administrators had come to the conclusion that Li Luo’s body simply, innately, lacked any resonance at all. In the future, it would be incredibly difficult for him to advance in his cultivation. After they reached this conclusion, the resonance instructure of the First School immediately requested that Li Luo be removed from the First School and sent to the Second School.
To be fair, this made sense. The First School was the place where all the most talented students were gathered, and the teacher simply didn’t want Li Luo to hold the others back. But of course, the other, more important reason was that right at that time, both of Li Luo’s parents had vanished. With them gone, House Luolan had quickly become the weakest of the four great Houses. Their position was now quite awkward.
And so, in the end, Li Luo had been sent to the Second School.
Xu Shanyue sighed to himself. When Li Luo had first arrived at the Second School, Zhao Kuo wasn’t even a match for him. Now, a mere semester later, Zhao Kuo was able to overwhelm him. If this continued, his ranking within the Second School would most likely continue to drop over the course of the next semester. Unless he was able to dramatically improve his performance, it was likely that he would stand no chance at all of being granted entry into the Astral Sage College.
The more Xu Shanyue looked at Li Luo’s calm, handsome features and his suave demeanor, the more pity he felt. He knew that the youth was incredibly hard-working, but his parents were simply so spectacular that everyone had incredible expectations for him. As a result, their prestige had become a source of tremendous pressure.
Everyone knew the saying that talented parents often had useless children, but few would delve deeper into the reasons behind this.
Li Luo cast a glance at the many pitying gazes aimed at him, swept the splinters off his clothes, then sat down cross-legged. He knew exactly what all of them were thinking, of course.
A blank resonance, eh? This pretty much guaranteed that his future prospects were dim. But… Li Luo smirked slightly. He couldn’t help but unconsciously reach down to touch his lower abdomen.
He had a secret which no one else knew. In his resonant palace, there was more than just a so-called ‘blank resonance’.
For cultivators of this world, at first their bodies would give birth to a single resonant palace; only later, when they reached the Duke stage, would they gain a second resonant palace. Finally, upon reaching the King stage, they would gain a third. However, the number of Dukes in the Xia Kingdom could be counted on one hand, while Kings were virtually unheard of despite how powerful the Xia Kingdom was.
But of course, there were no absolutes. Supposedly, there were some especially blessed individuals who had a chance of gaining a second resonant palace even before they reached the Duke stage. This happened naturally as their resonant power advanced, but the chances were incredibly low.
And this was what made Li Luo special.  Although he was still at the earliest Ten Seals stage, he didn’t have just one resonant palace in his body – he had three, which was completely unheard of!
Normally, only supreme experts who had reached the King stage would have three resonant palaces, but somehow this had manifested within his body. But what was even more shocking… was that all three palaces were blank!
Having a blank resonance meant your future prospects were dim.  But three blank resonances – did that mean you had a future, or not? Li Luo let out a sigh, a rather depressed look on his face. 
Just as Li Luo was feeling all these mixed emotions, Zhao Kuo came over and sat down next to him. Zhao Kuo whispered, “You still haven’t resolved your resonance problem, eh?”
Li Luo silently shook his head. Upon seeing this, Zhao Kuo let out a helpless sigh as well. Actually, he knew that this was a dumb question. A person was born with a resonance; it was innate, and no one had ever heard of someone later filling in a blank palace with something else. Clearly, Li Luo was facing a serious problem.
As the two chatted, Xu Shanyue walked into the dueling grounds. After giving Li Luo a few words of encouragement, he turned and said to the many students present, “Everyone, important exams will be starting next month. Your chances at entering a college will be dependent on your performance in the exams. I urge you all to train hard.”
The students were all silent, and they all had solemn looks on their faces. All their years of hard work were focused towards the exams coming up next month. If they were able to get into a college, then their future prospects would improve dramatically.
After this, Xu Shanyue announced that class was over. Li Luo and Zhao Kuo walked side-by-side as they left alongside the other students.
“I’m going to spend some more time training my resonance arts. Honestly, you gave me a good scare today. I suspect that if your resonant power was just slightly higher, you’d beat the pants off of me,” Zhao Kuo said with a sigh after exiting the training grounds. He then waved goodbye towards Li Luo.
Li Luo smiled as he watched Zhao Kuo depart. He knew the truth; Zhao Kuo was afraid that Li Luo was in poor spirits after this defeat, and so wanted to give him some alone time. What Zhao Kuo didn’t understand was that by now, Li Luo had grown accustomed to it all.
Li Luo withdrew his gaze, then turned and followed a tree-lined road that led outside the Academy. He ran into quite a few students as he walked, and all of them, both male and female, would glance at him as they passed. It wasn’t just because of his good looks; rather, it was because he was now a rather notorious figure at the Academy.
In the face of their gazes, Li Luo maintained a look of practiced indifference. He continued to follow the pathway until he reached the Academy gates, at which point he paused.
In front of him was a large number of students who were all speaking in a lively manner. These students were all surrounding a very special bluestone wall – the Southwind Academy’s Wall of Honor. It contained the descriptions of all the mighty figures who had once graduated from the Southwind Academy.
By now, all the students had seen the Wall of Honor countless times. Logically speaking, they should’ve grown weary of examining it long ago, but for some reason they were quite focused on it today.
Li Luo pursed his lips. He knew what was going on. The vast majority of the students here were because of ‘her’.
Li Luo turned his gaze to a very specific point on the Wall of Honor. There was a gleaming crystal at that point, emanating rays of light that slowly coalesced into a tall, willow, and almost lifelike figure.
The figure was that of a girl. She was dressed in the school uniform of Southwind Academy – a light blue cape, a simple white tunic, and a short black dress. She had a pair of long, dainty legs that were perfectly white and pleasing to the eye. 
Her facial features were similar exquisite. She had an elegant, raised nose, long and thick lashes, and snow-white skin. All of these were quite mesmerizing to behold, but it was her eyes that truly engraved her in everyone’s mind. 
Her pupils were golden, and they emanated an ineffable feeling of purity. If you stared into them long enough, you would begin to feel a sense of pressure.
Her gaze was rather cool, and she stared straight ahead, with one hand on her slender hips and the other resting on the hilt of a heavy sword. Any who saw her would instantly feel a sensation of heroic, fierce majesty emanating from her. She truly was a soul-stirring girl, in terms of both appearance and demeanor.
The wall behind her projection held her name – Jiang Qing’e. She was one of the dazzling star graduates of the Southwind Academy, born with a ninth-grade Light Resonance and enough talent to cause the countless people of the Xia Kingdom to sigh in amazement.
After spending just two years in the Academy, she had been immediately recruited by the Astral Sage College even though she had yet to take her graduation exams. In the past hundred years, she was the only person in Tianshu Province to receive such an honor. By now, she was a legend of the Southwind Academy, and the many students who had enrolled after her practically worshipped the ground she walked on. In fact, she was now incredibly famous throughout the entirety of the Xia Kingdom.
Li Luo stared at the projection of Jiang Qing’e in a daze for a few moments, before noticing that quite a few gazes had turned towards him. Those gazes were filled with a look of resentment, envy, and puzzlement.
Li Luo maintained his look of practiced indifference. He knew exactly why they were staring at him like that. It was because Jiang Qing’e, venerated almost like a goddess by both the male and female students of the Southwind Academy, had two other statuses. She had been trained by his parents since she was young… and she was his betrothed.
Or, to put it another way, she was his fiancée.


## Chapter 2: A Fiancee Who Doesn't Want An Annulment

As far as Li Luo could recall, the first time he met Jiang Qing’e was when he was three. His parents had just returned from a long journey, and on their return they had brought back the five-year-old Jiang Qing’e. Later on, they had accepted her as their disciple.
From a certain perspective, it could be said that the two of them truly were inseparable childhood friends, and his parents had truly doted on her as well.
Unfortunately, ever since they were young the relationship between the two was rather complicated. Jiang Qing’e was simply too outstanding, even as a child, and she was also two years older than Li Luo. Whenever they fought as children, the end result was invariably Jiang Qing’e beating the snot out of him in a calm manner until he submitted.
Honestly, it was a friggin’ nightmare.
As for the reason why she became his fiancée? Supposedly, when she was roughly ten or so years old, Li Luo’s father had commented in a drunken stupor that it would be wonderful if she one day became his daughter-in-law. The very next day, the ten-year-old Jiang Qing’e had personally written up a marriage contract and handed it over to Li Luo’s speechless father.
That night, Li Luo’s old man had almost been beaten senseless by Li Luo’s enraged mother. Worse – Li Luo had been watching and laughing at all of this, and as a result his mother had spanked the crap out of him as well.
Li Luo’s mother had asked Jiang Qing’e to annul the marriage contract. Unexpectedly, she put on a rare show of absolute stubbornness. Without saying a word, she simply knelt down before Li Luo’s mother and father and refused to rise.
In the end, Li Luo’s mother and father had no choice but to accede to her request. However, after doing so, they secreted away the marriage contract and never raised the topic again, pretending as though it had never existed.
As time had passed, nothing further was said on the matter. Everyone, even Li Luo himself, had long since forgotten about it. However, one day when Jiang Qing’e was at the Southwind Academy, she told a particularly determined suitor that she and Li Luo had long ago betrothed to each other.
This news had stunned the entire Academy; no, it had shocked the entire Tianshu Province! Thankfully, at that time Li Luo had yet to enter the Southwind Academy; otherwise, if he had, he would’ve instantly become an absolute pariah.
Even now, after the passage of so many years, Li Luo was still somewhat affected by the aftershocks of that announcement. From this, he keenly understood just how charismatic a figure Jiang Qing’e was.
“Pops, you really screwed me over,” Li Luo silently mumbled to himself.
“Yo, Li Luo! Why do you pause here every day? Are you enjoying the envious gazes of the crowds?” Just as Li Luo was sighing to himself, a girl’s voice suddenly rang out from behind him.
Li Luo turned, only to see an attractive young maiden standing behind him. Her hair was waist-long, and although she wasn’t quite up to par with Jiang Qing’e, she was definitely a natural beauty. The skin-tight school uniform she wore accentuated her lovely curves quite nicely.
At this moment, the young maiden was standing with arms folded across her chest, a rather mocking look on her face. Despite that, a calm look was on Li Luo’s face when he saw her. This was Difa Qing, one of his classmates. She was considered a beautiful golden flower of the Southwind Academy, and came from the Difa clan, one of the three great clans of the Tianshu Province.
She didn’t have anything against Li Luo. However, she was a diehard fan of Jiang Qing’e – the extremely over-zealous, almost obsessive type of diehard fan. In her eyes, Jiang Qing’e was as beautiful, flawless, and perfect as an Immortal fairy. There was no man in this world who was worthy of her – and of course, that included Li Luo as well.
Even though Difa Qing agreed that Li Luo was an exceedingly handsome fellow, she also felt that looks were superficial. Someone worthy of Jiang Qing’e had to be a dragon amongst men, both internally and externally. Li Luo, however, had only won a marriage contract with her thanks to his parents. In Difa Qing’s eyes, this was an absolute blemish on her goddess’ honor.
And so, ever since Li Luo had joined the Southwind Academy, whenever Difa Qing saw him she would first commence with a barrage of mocking words. After that? A series of endless questions.
“Li Luo, when are you going to annul the marriage contract between yourself and elder sister Jiang?”
Right on cue. She had repeated this question countless times by now. Even Li Luo couldn’t help but rub the bridge of his nose before responding irritably, “None of your damn business.” He then turned and left.
A look of anger instantly appeared on Difa Qing’s face. She stubbornly followed behind him. “Li Luo, do you really want to be the proverbial toad that lusts after a swan?”
Li Luo, however, simply continued to ignore her completely. This just further enraged her to the point where her veins started to pop out. She sped up her footsteps to chase him down, then continued, “Li Luo, if you refuse to annul the wedding contract, the only one who’s gonna be in trouble is you. The more talented elder sister Jiang is, the more trouble you’ll be in. Your parents have been missing for years now, and even House Luolan itself is at the verge of collapse. Your status as the young lord of the House isn’t going to be able to shield you for much longer.”
“You have no idea how many incredibly talented young men of Xia, all of whom have powerful backgrounds, are all smitten by her.
“Just because your parents treated her well, doesn’t mean you can force her to repay you like this!
“Li Luo, if you refuse to annul the marriage contract with her, even here in the Academy there will be people who will cause you trouble!”
Finally, Li Luo came to a halt. “Oh? And who might that be?”
Difa Qing let out a light snort. “I imagine you know who Bei Kun of the Bei clan is, yes? He’s already made it known that he hopes you will not rely on your status to force yourself on elder sister Jiang. He’s also requested that you have a small meeting with him at the Clearwind in two days.”
Li Luo chuckled. “I’m familiar with him, yes. In the past, he always liked to fawn over me.”
When his parents were still around, House Luolan’s words held almost as much weight as that of the governor of Tianshu Province. Bei Kun had often paid visits to Li Luo and professed his undying friendship. Who would’ve thought that a few scant years later, House Luolan’s situation would’ve completely changed and this former friend of his would now come and cause him trouble?
In the past, Bei Kun’s favorite pastime was to put on banquets at the Clearwind hotel, and he often would issue warm invitations to Li Luo. Now, he was proposing a hostile rendezvous? The man was straightforward enough.
Difa Qing said, “Li Luo, there’s no need for you to mock him. This is how the world is. When your clan is powerful, many will toady up to you. Now that House Luolan has weakened, why should others give you any face? Even in the past, the ones they were giving face to were your parents, not you.”
Li Luo nodded in agreement. “I quite agree with what you said.” During the course of the past two years, Li Luo had quickly come to learn just how fickle fortune and friendship could be. Thus, he said nothing else and instead sped up as he departed the Academy.
However, Difa Qing followed after him. She was seemingly unwilling to just let this rest, and continued yammering nonstop. Every single thing she said was aimed at one thing – that Li Luo should be willing to give Jiang Qing’e her freedom.
By now, Li Luo knew that the best way to deal with this type of person was to completely ignore her, and so he didn’t pay attention to a single word she said. Finally, after passing through a series of hallways, he exited the Academy.
As he did so, he suddenly noticed that the ambient noise level seemed to have dropped dramatically.  Even the mosquito-like buzzing of Difa Qing seemed to have come to a halt, as though she had a frog in her throat.
Li Luo turned to glance at her, only to see that her face was bright red. A look of excitement was in her eyes as she stared at the stone stairway outside the Academy.
Suspecting what was going on, Li Luo followed her gaze, only to see that a carriage was parked before the stairway. The carriage had an antique, noble design and was quite spacious. It had four pure red wheels, and was pulled by a muscular lionhorse. At the front of the carriage was a very familiar insignia – the House Luolan insignia.
As for the reason why Difa Qing’s face was crimson, and all the nearby students had looks of excitement on their faces? It naturally wasn’t just because of the House Luolan carriage itself – rather, it was the young woman standing in front of the carriage.
The young woman had her hair in a casual ponytail, and her features were both exquisite while graceful. Her skin shone beneath the rays of the setting sun. She was dressed in a short blue cape, held a thin whip, and wore a short war-skirt. Beneath the war-skirt was a pair of mouth-watering slim white legs… but most eye-catching of all was her pure, lustrous golden-pupiled eyes that shone like the sun.
It was Jiang Qing’e!
A series of murmurs began to arise from outside the Academy. Countless students were staring at her slender figure. They never would’ve imagined that on this day, they would have the chance to see in person this legendary graduate of the Southwind Academy.
Li Luo passed through the murmuring, excited crowd as he walked down the steps, then moved next to Jiang Qing’e. Rather surprised, he said, “Sister Qing’e, when did you return to Southwind City?” Although House Luolan had arisen in Southwind, after becoming one of the four great Houses of the Xia Kingdom, it had already shifted its headquarters to the capital of the Xia Kingdom, the city of Xia.
After Jiang Qing’e had been admitted into the Astral Sage College, the most supreme college of the Xia Kingdom, she too had moved to Xia City. Over the past two years, she had also been consumed with affairs regarding the management of House Luolan, and so it was quite rare for her to return to Southwind. It had been quite some time since even Li Luo had seen her.
Jiang Qing’e glanced at him, then said in a calm voice, “Tomorrow is your seventeenth birthday. In addition, House Luolan has some important business to be discussed here. I just arrived at Southwind today, so I thought I’d come pick you up and take you home.” Her voice was extremely pleasing to hear – it was both crisp and calm, like water from a deep mountain spring that was falling upon jade.
Li Luo nodded. The attitude that Jiang Qing’e was displaying didn’t surprise him in the slightest. He had known her for ages now; this was just how her personality was.
“Let’s go, then,” he said. Jiang Qing’e was simply too popular here at Southwind Academy. Just by standing here, she had become the focal attention of the entire area. He himself felt as though everyone was staring daggers at him.
Jiang Qing’e nodded slightly, but she didn’t immediately turn back. Instead, she looked at the excited Difa Qing, who was standing right behind Li Luo. “Your name is Difa Qing, yes?”
Difa Qing nodded repeatedly, her face ruddy from excitement. “You actually still remember me, elder sister Jiang?”
Jiang Qing’e said quietly, “I hope you won’t bother Li Luo any more. Otherwise… I will probably have to take extremely good care of your elder brother at the Astral Sage College.”
The look of excitement on Difa Qing’s face instantly froze. A long moment later, transfixed by Jiang Qing’e’s golden gaze, she nervously nodded. She no longer displayed any of the earlier confidence and arrogance that she had shown before Li Luo.
After speaking, Jiang Qing’e turned and entered the carriage alongside Li Luo, her blue cape flapping slightly. Moments later, the lionhorse let out a long bellow before it carried them away through the mist.
As for Difa Qing, she just stood there and watched the carriage depart. A long while later, she finally rubbed her eyes, an intoxicated look on her face.
“Elder sister Jiang… she’s SO COOL!  I absolutely ADOOOORE her!”


## Chapter 3: Li Luo Wants An Annulment

The lionhorse rapidly galloped through the wide streets of Southwind City. It pulled the carriage behind it in a stable yet fast manner, causing the forest of buildings to rapidly disappear.
The inside of the carriage was quite spacious, and the temperature was quite comfortable. Li Luo and Jiang Qing’e were seated facing each other, with a small tea table between them. The two didn’t exchange many words – Li Luo just sat there calmly with his eyes closed, while Jiang Qing’e had opened up a book and was intently reading it.
A ray of sunlight shone into the carriage from a crack in the curtains, falling upon Jiang Qing’e’s exquisite jade features and giving her an almost crystalline, translucent complexion.
After a long period of silence, Jiang Qing’e blinked her long lashes, lifted up her slender face, then stared intently at Li Luo with her golden eyes. “It seems the words I spoke at Southwind Academy all those years ago have caused you some trouble. I’m very sorry about that.”
Li Luo remained silent, but he opened his eyes. He looked back at her, noting her exquisite features as well as her aura of strength and fierceness, then chuckled. “I don’t see any sincerity in this apology. If you are sincere, then let me cancel our engagement.”
Jiang Qing’e flipped through a few more pages. “Is this the legendary ‘annulment request’? But according to the way the script is supposed to play out, I should be the one making this request. Have you perhaps gotten things backwards?”
Li Luo was caught off-guard by her sudden display of deadpan humor. For a moment, he didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry.
Jiang Qing’e raised her head and cast him a glance, then said calmly, “What’s the problem? Are you afraid that our engagement will cause you even more problems in the future?”
Li Luo was silent for a moment, then shook his head. “I’m worried that I would be holding you back. There’s no reason for a girl like you to be burdened by an unnecessary engagement. And while we are on this topic – do you know how many times my old man got his ass kicked by my mom because of this engagement? Now, I personally supported her kicking his ass for him coming up with such a stupid idea, but the real problem was – each time, after she finished kicking his ass, I would get my ass kicked as well!”
A resentful look appeared in Li Luo’s eyes as he discussed this. As for Jiang Qing’e, when she thought back to how that normally gentle and refined woman had repeatedly giving drubbings to both Li Luo and his father for her sake, her small red lips couldn’t help but quiver in amusement. Afterwards, she calmed back down and shook her head. “I’m not worried.”:
Li Luo felt a headache coming. “Then what if you fall for someone else in the future? This is absolutely ridiculous, you know.”
Jiang Qing’e smiled calmly. “I might not meet such a person. I’m quite picky, you know… and now that the two of us are engaged, there’s no way I’d give my heart to another.”
Li Luo stared hard at Jiang Qing’e. Suddenly, a hint of anger entered his voice. “Jiang Qing’e, what the hell are you thinking? I know my parents treated you well, and you are very grateful towards them, but there’s no need for you to express your gratitude this way. What the hell do you take me for? A tool for you to show gratitude? You might have agreed to this engagement, but I never did!”
Li Luo’s sudden show of anger startled her. She stared pensively at him with her pure golden eyes for a long, silent moment, then lowered her head slightly. “I apologize. I admit that I didn’t take your feelings into consideration.”
Seeing this, Li Luo pressed the advantage. “If that’s the case, then we should-”
“However!” Jiang Qing’e raised her head again, then stared at Li Luo intently. “You know what the rules of our House are. If two House members are unable to come to an agreement, then the only way to resolve it is through a duel. The winner gets to make the final decision.”
This was a rule which Li Luo’s mother had laid down, and it was applicable to any household disagreements whatsoever. Thus – every time she and Li Luo’s father had gotten into an argument, she would roll up her sleeves and then drag the old man into the training grounds to fight it out.
“If you truly are completely unwilling to be engaged to me, then we can go to the family training grounds and then resolve it in accordance with our House rules,” Jiang Qing’e said.
Li Luo’s face turned comically stiff for a moment, before a variety of expressions flashed through it. Finally, he gritted his teeth, pointed at her, and said furiously, “Jiang Qing’e, you go too far! I’m still in the early stages of the Ten Seals. How the hell am I supposed to fight against you, an Earth Fiend?”
Human cultivators, after establishing their resonant palace, were considered to have entered the most rudimentary stage, the Ten Seals stage. After this came the Resonant Master stage, at which point they could be considered to have truly embarked into the path of cultivation.
There were three primary levels to the Resonant Master stage – General, Duke, and King. Putting aside the latter two stages for now, the ‘General’ level itself also consisted of two sub-levels; the upper level was known as the Heavenly Dipper General, while the lower sub-level was known as the Earth Fiend General. As for Jiang Qing’e? She was already at the Earth Fiend General level. [1]
For someone so young to be able to become an Earth Fiend General was simply stunning. Everyone was truly shocked by Jiang Qing’e and her talent. Some even suspected that she would soon be the one to break the record for being the youngest Duke of the Xia Kingdom.
For an Earth Fiend General like her to battle against Li Luo, who was still in the Ten Seals stage… honestly, Li Luo was rather worried that if she might whack him to death with a palm, just by accident.
Jiang Qing’e put away the book, then said in a regretful manner, “It seems you don’t want to accept my proposal. There’s nothing else I can do.”
Li Luo was so furious, he was shaking. What the hell is wrong with the world? Why is it so hard for me to annul my engagement? He then turned to stare lifelessly out the carriage window. From the corner of his eyes, he could still catch a glimpse of Jiang Qing’e – specifically, her dazzlingly exquisite features and her intoxicatingly pure golden eyes.
Li Luo let out a sigh, then said in a much more subdued voice, “Big sister Qing, we’ve known each other for years. I know very well that the feelings you have for me are not romantic in nature. What’s the point of being engaged when love isn’t part of the picture?”
Jiang Qing’e was silent for a moment. “Honestly, my first reaction is to say – a seventeen-year-old kid like you shouldn’t put on such worldly airs. But, I have to admit that you do speak some sense. However, I have no interest in any other men at all. As for you – at least I don’t find you repulsive.”
Li Luo let out a bitter chuckle. “Big sister Qing, the main reason you set up this engagement was to show your gratitude to my parents. I’m sure that your feelings towards them are much stronger than any feelings you might have towards me. But… I really have no need for this form of ‘gratitude’.”
Li Luo lowered his head. He said in a slow voice, “I know that it isn’t going to be easy to get you to annul this engagement, but…” He raised his head to stare directly into her eyes. “I hope that you will give me, and yourself, a chance.”
Li Luo paused a moment, then continued. “Let’s do a trade. I’m not strong enough to manage our House, and so in the interim you have taken over on my behalf. One day, however, I will take back control. If on that day, you are able to return to me a House that is more-or-less as strong and prosperous as the one you took over, then as my way of showing gratitude, I will ‘grant’ you freedom from this engagement. Deal?”
Jiang Qing’e did not immediately respond. For a long, silent moment, she tapped her long, slender white fingers on the table in a rhythmic manner. Finally, she said in a soft voice, “Li Luo. Do you really dislike me that much?”
Li Luo was startled. He took a deep breath, then said, “Jiang Qing’e, I think you may have underestimated your attractiveness and your appeal. Your beauty and your charisma is enough to cause anyone of our age to be instantly smitten with you. If I claimed to have no interest in you at all, then I would be lying to both myself as well as to you.”
“But. This is not the type of engagement I want, or need.”
Jiang Qing’e raised an eyebrow, then suddenly smacked the table with one dainty hand.
Crack! The sudden sound jolted Li Luo, causing him to quickly sidle backwards. “Hey, let’s keep it civilized! No need to resort to violence.”
Jiang Qing’e rolled her eyes at him, then said calmly, “Li Luo, it’s been a while since we’ve met. Clearly, you’ve become a bit more eloquent since then. I agree that your words have some merit. Fine. We can treat this as a trade. Once you are ready to assume control over House Luolan, I’ll be sure to hand it over in a healthy, intact state. At that time, you can annul our engagement.”
Li Luo was speechless, then let out a long sigh. He instantly felt as though he had been relieved of a heavy burden. However – in the deepest part of his heart, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of inexplicable loss. He cursed at himself for feeling this. The hell is wrong with you?
“Your little speech today has caused me to look upon you in a new light. It seems you are no longer a little boy.”
Li Luo was irritated. “Little boy? There’s nothing little about me.”
Jiang Qing’e ignored his words. She gaze at him with an enigmatic half-smile, then continued, “But, Li Luo… I do have to give you a little reminder. Are you absolutely sure you want to enter this deal with me? Once our engagement is off – I suspect that you will never, ever have a chance to get it back.”
Li Luo narrowed his eyes, then leaned forward with both hands pressed to the desk and stared directly at Jiang Qing’e. Their faces were less than a foot apart. “Jiang Qing’e, I really have no interest in this type of ‘engagement’ – because in the future, I intend for you to personally hand me an engagement agreement, rather than hand my parents one.”
Jiang Qing’e stared right back into Li Luo’s handsome face with her golden eyes, the amusement on her face growing stronger. She knew exactly what Li Luo meant. The reason why he wanted to annul this marriage agreement was because as of right now, she had no interest in him as a man. If in the future, she once more proposed to be engaged to him, it would only be because she had fallen for him.
“Sit your butt down.” Her red lips quivered. Suddenly, an invisible force appeared out of nowhere and pressed Li Luo back into seat with enough force to cause him to let out an involuntary squawk.
Just like that, all of his posturing had been wiped away.
Jiang Qing’e rested a hand on her fragrant cheeks, then cast Li Luo a rather lazy look. “You don’t have a lot of skills, but you sure have a lot of guts. I’ve encountered many geniuses in recent years, but none of them ever dared to speak to me like this. Li Luo – don’t let your reach exceed your grasp by too much. Your goal is completely unrealistic. But – if you really want to give it a shot, I’ll give you a chance.”
Her golden pupils suddenly glowed with a mysterious, inscrutable light. “I’ll wait for you at the Astral Sage College. This is your first step. If you can’t even accomplish this, then let’s both just forget about what you said today. We’ll chalk it up as being the words of a rebellious youth.”
This time, Li Luo didn’t interrupt. He leaned back against the carriage window as he slowly closed his eyes. He said in a calm voice, “Then just wait for me there.”
Jiang Qing’e turned her gaze out the window. As she watched their carriage move past the various buildings, a stray ray of sunlight sparkled across her golden eyes. The tiniest of smiles appeared on her face, filled with a rare look of softness.
After they had traveled for a long period of time, Li Luo suddenly opened his eyes. Rather puzzled, he said, “This isn’t the way home.”
Jiang Qing’e gently nodded, then said quietly, “We’re going to pay a visit to the Golden Dragon Bank. There’s something we need to pick up there.”
She turned her golden gaze towards Li Luo. “Before Master and Mistress left, they prepared something for you. They said that you were only to open it up after you reached the age of seventeen.”
Li Luo was speechless. His heart shook. Mom, Dad… you left something behind for me?
1. These stages come from the Tales of the Water Margin/Suikoden; there were 108 legendary heroes, who were divided into the 36 ‘heavenly dippers’ and the 72 ‘earthly fiends’. 


## Chapter 4: Golden Dragon Bank

Many mighty and influential factions were hidden within the Xia Kingdom. Of which, two were behemoths that held stances of absolute neutrality. These were titans that even officials and the royal family would never dare to aggravate. 
The first was the renowned Astral Sage College. The second, the Golden Dragon Bank.
Attending the Astral Sage College was the aspiration of numerous Xia Kingdom youths. The elites that graduated from there were often courted by the numerous powers of the land. 
The Golden Dragon Bank, on the other hand, was involved in the trading, safekeeping, and auctioning of all sorts of goods and treasures. Their financial might was so immense that any power would stare at their wealth with reddened eyes. Yet no one dared to even dream of infringing on their interests! The true might of the Golden Dragon Bank far superseded any power in the Xia Kingdom. The branch that existed in the Xia Kingdom was just that, a mere branch! 
The main branch of the Golden Dragon Bank was located in a place far more vast than the Xia Kingdom, and they had a resounding reputation across the land. This was because the golden dragon notes issued by the bank could be redeemed for an equivalent amount of skygold at any branch.
………
The City of Southwind was the county town of the Tianshu Province. It naturally housed its own branch of the Golden Dragon Bank, which was unsurprisingly located in the most luxurious area: the center of the city.  
As Li Luo got off the carriage, he gazed at the glorious and dazzling building before him. This was not the first time he had laid eyes on a building so grand, yet he couldn’t help but exhale in wonder. Even a branch building in a simple county town exhibited grandeur beyond its humble surroundings. The financial resources of the Golden Dragon Bank were truly unfathomable.  
Even House Luolan’s estate seemed lacking when compared to this behemoth.
Jiang Qing’e’s expression was calm and unperturbed. Upon exiting the carriage, she immediately made his way towards the bank with Li Luo in tow.
After entering this magnificent bank, Jiang Qing’e withdrew a golden note from her belongings, which she then passed to an attendant. The note was carefully inspected before the attendant hastily and respectfully ushered the two into a VIP room. 
Moments later, a beaming, plump, middle-aged man waddled in. He was bedecked with all sorts of glittering jewels, each and every one of his fingers clad with numerous rings!
“Haha! I am honored to be in the presence of House Luolan’s Young Lord and Miss Jiang. You have truly brought great honor to my humble dwelling.” It is important to keep in mind that anyone who could act on behalf of the Golden Dragon Bank would definitely be socially adept. Since the plump man could recognise Li Luo at a glance, he also understood his current status. Yet he did not slight Li Luo in the least, and he provided him all due respect, even addressing him first.
“This is the supervisor of the Tianshu Province’s Golden Dragon Bank, President Lu.” Jiang Qing’e casually introduced the other party to Li Luo. 
“President Lu, do lead us to retrieve the goods.” With the brief introductions complete, Jiang Qing’e reverted to her usual swift and decisive demeanour.
President Lu nodded and smiled, turning to lead the way. The three of them weaved through layers upon layers of restrictions before making their way deep under the building. 
Following President Lu’s lead, the three arrived in front of a completely sealed room with no entrances. Instead, there were smooth, glossy, black stone walls on all sides, making it seem like a room surrounded by black mirrors.
President Lu then lightly patted the wall. His actions made the wall split apart, allowing the group to enter the room. A box made of an unknown metal gradually emerged from the ground within the room.
President Lu smiled as he explained, “My respected guests, this is the object that the Lord of House Luolan left behind. In his words, the Young Lord has to retrieve this personally, and his blood will act as the key.” With his job complete, he naturally slunk away, leaving the other two in the room.
Li Luo stared at this safety deposit box of sorts, almost in a trance. Just what were his parents up to, leaving him with all this secrecy and mystery? What had they left behind?
Yet his intuition was screaming at him, telling him that the object in front of him was of utmost importance. Perhaps it could change his ill fate?
He took a deep breath and stepped forward, placing his palm on the strongbox. At this moment, he felt a piercing pain in his finger, as if a drop of blood was forcefully seized from him and absorbed by this strongbox!
Click!
Mechanical clicks could be heard coming from within the strongbox. A faint luster gradually emerged from the center as the strongbox cracked apart.
At this point, Li Luo could finally see what was within.
It was a pitch-black crystal ball. It was extremely smooth, so much so that Li Luo could even see his own reflection. There were clearly some unspoken mysteries surrounding this object.
“Just what…” Li Luo mumbled as he blinked while inspecting the crystal ball.
“Let’s store it carefully for now. Master said that you had to wait for your 17th birthday before you could retrieve this.” Jiang Qing’e passed a suitcase over.
Li Luo nodded as he carefully placed the black crystal ball inside the suitcase, tightly holding onto it for dear life as his eyes moistened.
“What’s wrong?” Jiang Qing’e asked with a puzzled expression.
“I have a hunch that my lucky break is finally here. I’m so emotional, I could cry!” Li Luo exclaimed as he waved the suitcase towards her. “Just you wait… I’m definitely going to succeed in annulling this marriage!”
“….” Jiang Qing’e couldn’t be bothered to respond. She immediately turned around and left the secret room. She could clearly tell that Li Luo was surging with excitement and was definitely itching to irritate her.
The two left the depths of the building and were once again greeted by President Lu. This time, he was accompanied by a young lady.
She was garbed in green and was exceptionally beautiful, with an elegant and exquisite charm to her. Her fine, black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, reaching her willowy waist. This was coupled with a set of captivating eyes that shone brightly. Her snow-white skin gave off a crystal-like sheen. She was eye-catching, the very embodiment of perfection.
Even though her hands were clad in thin, silk gloves, one could faintly make out her slender, jade-like fingers. If she ever removed those gloves, there would be people drooling at the sight of her ephemeral beauty. 
Possessing both beauty and temperament, this young lady was clearly a level above Difa Qing.
Upon seeing her, an unnatural expression flashed across Li Luo’s face before he regained his composure.
“Haha, this is my little niece, Lu Qing’er. She has just been accepted into Southwind Academy as a cultivator, and she absolutely idolizes Miss Jiang. When she heard you were here, she was adamant in coming along. I do hope that Miss Jiang will not take offense to this,” President Lu explained as he clasped his hands respectfully with a smile on his face. 
“Greetings, Senior Sister Jiang,” Lu Qing’er said with deference as she graciously curtsied. 
Jiang Qing’e began to size up this new arrival with perfectly symmetrical features. “Since you’re a student of Southwind Academy, I suppose you’re acquaintances with Li Luo?” 
Lu Qing’er shifted her gaze momentarily to glance at Li Luo, who was standing by Jiang Qing’e’s side. She beamed as she gently nodded, her deep gaze captivating all. “Li Luo used to provide me with some pointers, and I’ve always been thankful to him. However, it seems like in these past two years, he hasn’t wanted to meet me…”
Li Luo let out an awkward smile as he hastily and laughingly replied, “No, no, no, no, no, please don’t jump to conclusions! We are in different schools, so it’s been very difficult to come see you!” Deep down, Li Luo felt helpless. Lu Qing’er was exceptionally famous in Southwind Academy. She was in a completely different strata compared to Difa Qing. Not only was she attractive, she was the poster girl for Southwind Academy, being the number one talent in the current generation.
When Li Luo was still attending the First School, many of the students had yet to open their resonant palaces. With his exceptional ability to utilise resonance arts, he was a cut above the rest of the students. Hence, numerous students would approach him for guidance, including Lu Qing’er.
Therefore, they could be considered close friends.
Then came Li Luo’s misfortune of blank palaces and his subsequent booting from the First School into the Second School. As a result, their interactions became sparse.
Of course, the most important point here was that Li Luo spent his time hiding from Lu Qing’er. It wasn’t because he hated her, but because he felt embarrassed whenever they met! He used to be number one in the First School, and yet he had been supplanted by her…
Who would have thought that they would meet each other again?
Lu Qing’er did not rebut Li Luo’s clearly perfunctory words but didn’t say anything else either. Instead, she turned her attention to Jiang Qing’e and began to chat with her with a casual smile on her face.
The Lu duo then proceeded to escort the two out of the bank.
“Miss Jiang, I’ve heard that there will be an event happening at House Luolan,” President Lu said with his usual, smiley demeanor.
Jiang Qing’e’s expression was unchanging as she replied flatly, “President Lu is perceptive indeed.” 
“Ah, such a pity!” President Lu sighed before continuing, “Do look for me if there is anything I can assist you with. The Golden Dragon Bank believes that harmony breeds wealth!” 
Li Luo held some doubts in his mind, but he did not voice them. He simply followed Jiang Qing’e onto the carriage, and they swiftly left.
Meanwhile, President Lu rubbed the chin of his oily, portly face as he glimpsed at Lu Qing’er, only to realise that she was still staring wistfully at the direction of the departing carriage with her sparkling eyes.  
“Cough!” President Lu interrupted her. “You little girl! You… you wouldn’t happen to have feelings for Li Luo, would you?” 
Lu Qing’er batted a glance towards President Lu as she gently replied, “I only feel pity towards Li Luo. In the past, he did guide me in the resonance arts. I merely feel appreciation towards him. If not for his blank palaces, he would have been my greatest rival in Southwind Academy.” 
President Lu patted his chest as he released a sigh of relief. “Thank goodness! That’s great… Qing’er, oh, Qing’er, he is already an engaged man. Don’t try scoring when there’s a goalkeeper… With your status and looks, just which youth in the Xia Kingdom could be your match?” 
Lu Qing’er shook her head and then turned around to walk away, ignoring her second uncle’s inane ramblings whilst he chuckled and continued to rub his chin.


## Chapter 5: Senior Pei Hao

After leaving the Golden Dragon Bank, Jiang Qing’e was silent within the carriage. Li Luo followed suit and spoke nary a word, only clutching the suitcase. Who knew what he was thinking.
Eventually, they arrived in front of a manor, within which dotted numerous undulating hills and magnificent pavilions—an awe-inspiring sight. 
This was where Li Luo’s parents had constructed the family home of House Luolan. 
The four beastial lionhorses stopped gracefully in front of the gates and then the duo exited the carriage.
“This place seems to have become a lot colder and lifeless.” Jiang Qing’e sighed as she stared at the manor.
Back when Li Luo’s parents were still around, this was the administrative epicentre of House Luolan. The bustling activity as people hurried about then greatly contrasted against the decrepit silence seen now.   
“House Luolan’s headquarters has long shifted to Xia City, this is just an old manor. I suppose this peace and quiet is expected.” Li Luo smiled. 
Whilst the two spoke, some individuals approached the entrance to usher them in.
At the fore was an old man, with a lady right behind him. The old man had a gentle and amiable expression. The lady, on the other hand, wore a face of makeup that accentuated her maturity, providing an attractive countenance. What was most outstanding was her well-rounded figure; her twin peaks were well endowed, much like two completely ripe peaches, a sight that would slay men as they swayed gently.  
“Uncle Liu,” Li Luo cried as he ran towards the old man. He was someone who had followed Li Luo’s parents long ago. Nowadays, he stayed to maintain the estate whilst taking care of Li Luo.
Yet Li Luo did not recognise this well-endowed lady and doubts began to arise in his mind.
“Uncle Liu, it has been a long time,” Jiang Qing’e said as she nodded her head before introducing the lady to Li Luo. “This is Elder Sister Cai Wei, my assistant in Xia City. She has been helping me to arrange the numerous affairs of House Luolan.” 
“Greetings, Young Lord,” the mature beauty Cai Wei said with a smiling expression as her eyes sized Li Luo up. 
Li Luo nodded in reply. “It must have been hard on you, Elder Sister Cai Wei.”
“Elder Sister Cai Wei will be staying in the City of Southwind for a period of time. She will be taking care of House Luolan’s affairs in the Tianshu Province and will be directly reporting to you in all matters,” Jiang Qing’e explained.
Li Luo was momentarily shocked. Ever since House Luolan’s headquarters relocated to Xia City, nothing much had cropped up within the Tianshu Province and things had been stable since then. Now, in the blink of an eye, why had Sister Qing’e suddenly deployed such a capable individual to assume control of the situation? 
“Has something happened?” Li Luo queried as he sighed deeply.
Jiang Qing’e’s sudden return was clearly unrelated to his upcoming seventeenth birthday tomorrow.
Jiang Qing’e paused in deep thought. Her usual, exquisite expression had turned cold as she strode towards the interior of the manor, Li Luo trailing right behind her.
“Although you’ve been left in the City of Southwind, I suppose you have not heard of the news surrounding House Luolan. I did not speak of these things for fear of affecting you.” As they walked on the light gravel road, scattered light filtered through the leaves of the surrounding trees, bathing their path with warmth, contrasting against Jiang Qing’e’s direct and cold words. 
Li Luo nodded. Although he did not take part in House Luolan’s affairs, even a blockhead could guess that with the absence of his parents, House Luolan would be faced with turbulent winds.
Starting a house within the Xia Kingdom was not such a simple task. The most important rule was that one had to have a Duke.
Within the Xia Kingdom were five great houses, and House Luolan was one of them.
Out of these five, House Luolan had the shortest history and had also risen the most abruptly. This was due to both of Li Luo’s parents entering the Duke Stage.
Mysterious Yang Duke, Li Taixuan.
Misty Duke, Tan Tailan.
A house with two Dukes. This was the key reason why House Luolan had catapulted into the ranks of the five Great Houses so quickly. Whilst the rest of the five Great Houses had long established histories, House Luolan was a complete upstart. As a result, this also meant that they had less of a foundation and barely any assets to speak of, and were thus weaker than the other four by a fair margin.  
This was originally not an issue as Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan’s abilities were more than sufficient to cover this gap during this time.
Hence, it was a pity that they both had disappeared.
Losing their two main pillars of support, House Luolan’s strength declined rapidly. At the onset of their disappearance, their reputation still served to deter any unsavory intentions. However, with the passage of time, the lack of news regarding Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan had ended up birthing rumors that they had met their demise in the Noble’s War.
House Luolan, as one of the five Great Houses, had numerous businesses under them. This was undoubtedly a fat, succulent piece of meat for any power within the Xia Kingdom. Numerous factions had been eyeing it covetously, drooling at the mouths for a potential bite.
Thus, with the passage of time, Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan’s inheritance had been gradually whittled down. A few wolves could barely resist the temptation in these past few years and had taken quite a few mouthfuls.
With such a situation afoot, Jiang Qing’e had to put pause to her studies in the Astral Sage College to take over the affairs of House Luolan. As a result, her reputation in the Xia Kingdom had soared. Unfortunately, she had yet to enter the Duke Stage, so her strength was insufficient to deter this pack of hungry wolves. In this dire situation, she had chosen to give up some of the businesses, opting to recover them when the House had recouped its strength. 
By showing little resistance, it signalled to the wider world that the situation within House Luolan was terribly unstable, battered by the oncoming winds.
Li Luo understood very clearly at this point that without sufficient strength, trying to guard a mountain of gold would only bring trouble to oneself. Patiently enduring was the sensible long-term strategy. 
“I’ve heard of House Luolan’s decline in these few years. Perhaps things have begun to stabilise?” Li Luo asked curiously. 
Jiang Qing’e pursed her lips as she calmly replied, “External pressure has temporarily reduced. However, the problem now lies within House Luolan’s headquarters.” 
Li Luo was dumbfounded for a second before he slowly asked, “Is it due to Senior Pei Hao?”
Cai Wei stared at Li Luo with a flabbergasted expression.
“Although Sister Qing’e has not been in charge of House Luolan for long, your charm is unparalleled and your strength within the house is not insignificant. The only member of House Luolan who can compete with you is that Senior disciple my parents took in.” Li Luo smiled as he explained his deduction. 
Pei Hao was a wandering vagrant in his youth. He had offended an enemy and would have been executed if not for the lucky intervention of Li Luo’s parents. Seeing how pitiful he was, they accepted him into House Luolan and his talents were gradually unearthed, demonstrating his genius. When House Luolan officially made their mark, he was officially taken in as a disciple. 
With this background, Pei Hao’s position in House Luolan soared into the heavens, and by the time of Li Luo’s parents’ disappearance, he had already accumulated quite a bit of power.
When his parents were still around, Senior Pei Hao would often come to interact with Li Luo. Over the years, these interactions had gradually become more rare, especially after it was discovered that Li Luo had blank palaces…
It was clear that Senior Pei Hao wasn’t a very genuine person.
“Pei Hao has always objected to my control of House Luolan. He has also acted arbitrarily when it came to decisions regarding the house. His influence within House Luolan is not minor—at least half of the Inner Council of Nine supports him. This has brought about some unsavory influences on the situation.
“Frankly speaking, if he was willing to act on behalf of House Luolan, then all of this would be tolerable. If not for Masters’ orders, I would not have wanted to make a move and take control.” Li Luo nodded in agreement. With Jiang Qing’e’s personality, she definitely disliked this sort of responsibility. Focusing on cultivation would’ve been ideal, considering her gratuitous talents.
Though in the end, all of these problems had arisen because the Young Lord just wasn’t up to par. Both of them understood that with his current predicament of possessing blank palaces, he was helpless in such a situation. If they passed control to him, it would more or less spell doom for everything his parents had toiled for.
Furthermore, in this world, might made right. 
“It must have been hard on you, Sister Qing’e,” Li Luo sincerely said from the depths of his heart.
Jiang Qing’e shook her head. “No need for this display. We are already engaged, and I’m also part of House Luolan… in case you already forgot and need a beating to remind yourself,” she replied bluntly. 
Li Luo was speechless at this retort, whilst Cai Wei laughed while coyly covering her mouth, her appearance capable of moving anyone. 
Jiang Qing’e continued, “Ever since the two Masters disappeared, everyone has been on tenterhooks. Although I have done my best to pacify everyone, the situation House Luolan is in is not something that can be resolved easily. Meanwhile, Pei Hao continues to goad and rally the support of the people, constantly seeking to suppress me. I’ve done some investigating, and I suspect that there are greater forces at play, secretly assisting him.” 
Li Luo reached out to catch a falling leaf before musing, “We seem to have raised a wolf in our home.”
“Pei Hao will bring some men to discuss terms in the City of Southwind tomorrow. If we are unable to come to a consensus, the worst case scenario is that House Luolan will directly disintegrate and a heavy blow will be dealt to us.” Jiang Qing’e’s golden pupils seemed to become as icy as the cold of winter—even a trace of killing intent could be seen.
Li Luo raised his eyebrows in puzzlement. House Luolan was surrounded by wolves in the Xia Kingdom, and furthermore, there were even more tigers eyeing them from the sidelines. If they did fall apart, House Luolan would be severely weakened, and inevitable troubles would follow.
All he could do now was sigh. He was just too weak, unable to influence the situation at all. The title of Young Lord within House Luolan was an empty one. In fact, people had completely disregarded and forgotten about him.
Everything stemmed from being powerless.
“I apologize. I have been unable to help,” Li Luo said.
Jiang Qing’e shook her head as she lightly replied, “Rest assured. Even if turmoil engulfs House Luolan, I will ensure it is rebuilt before I hand it back over to you.” Li Luo did not reply. He didn’t really mind either way. Even if House Luolan were the mightiest one around, it was ultimately external strength. In this world, only personal might was absolute.
If he could enter the King or Duke stages at some point, all of these problems would disappear like a wisp of smoke.
The two then entered their old home and had dinner. Immediately after, Jiang Qing’e excused herself and rushed off, evidently to make preparations for tomorrow.
Li Luo did not disturb her. Instead, he spent two hours practicing the resonance arts before retiring to his room for rest.
Try as he might, he couldn’t fall asleep. When the clock struck midnight, he directly rolled off his bed and grabbed the suitcase before wrenching it open.
He pulled out the mysterious, black crystal ball and carefully clasped it between his hands. Li Luo could feel his heart palpitating as it almost burst out of his chest in excitement.
“Father. Mother. Just what did you leave behind for me?”
Li Luo lightly patted his chest as he spoke self-deprecatingly, “There’s no way you left behind a birthday cake you made countless years ago… right?” He gulped.


## Chapter 6: Acquired Resonance

The black crystal ball with a mirror-like sheen allowed Li Luo to see his countenance within. A trace of anticipation, lashed with anxiety, was hung upon his gaze.
He wanted to know just what sort of item would lead his parents to spend so much effort to squirrel away…
“Soooo… just how do I open this?” Li Luo was doing everything he could to quash the feelings of anxiousness in his heart. Cautiously inspecting the ink-black and mysterious crystal ball, he finally decided to… use the most direct method instead. He tentatively pressed his palms against its surface.
Weng!
At the exact moment his palms contacted the crystal ball, the crystal ball emitted a slight shock! That originally shiny exterior liquefied and enveloped Li Luo’s palms.
At the same time, Li Luo could distinctly feel a sensation not unlike acupuncture, as though needles were piercing right into him, into his palms! As this happened, some of his blood was absorbed! 
The palms which were covered with the black liquid then began to radiate a bright light. Then, to Li Luo’s surprise, two light apparitions gradually took form. 
Looking at the familiar silhouettes, Li Luo could feel a wave of nostalgia and yearning descend upon him. 
“Dad, Mom…” The male apparition was handsome, his body upright like a spear whilst clothed in white robes. He possessed an absolute charm and a warm smile, yet hidden within was a lofty and immovable presence that would bend to no one! Just looking at him brought others an indescribable sense of comfort and safety. 
On the other hand, the female apparition was garbed in violet, her long hair elegantly pinned up, her two hands leisurely placed within her pockets. She, too, was of incomparable beauty and held an unparalleled, dignified demeanor.
These were Li Luo’s parents, Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan.
As Li Luo stared blankly at the two, the apparition of Li Taixuan began to speak. “Haha, my little boy, now that you’re seeing these imprints, I assume you are seventeen already. I believe that by this point, we are long gone.” 
Tan Tailan, who was smiling happily at the side, also began to speak. “Little Luo must have become even more handsome by now, right? Have any girls begun to court you in school?” 
Li Luo rubbed his eyes as he mumbled to himself, “Your son did not only become extremely handsome, he also became absolutely unmatched! Just who would dare to court me…?” 
“Are you feeling full of grievances right now? Do you feel that nothing has gone right for you?” At this point, Li Taixuan began to chuckle again, as though he could see right through the frustrations in Li Luo’s heart. 
His mom continued, “Perhaps because of the blank palaces within you?”
At this point, Li Luo was shocked. By the time his blank palaces had manifested, his parents had been missing for years. Just how could they have known of his situation?
“Little Luo, don’t be surprised. We used some special methods to observe your body’s situation long before your resonant palaces manifested. In fact, you even have three resonant palaces.” Tan Tailan soothed him with a doting gaze in her eyes.
Li Luo’s jaw dropped. So it seems as though his parents knew of his unique situation a long time ago. Then in this case, did his parents’ disappearance have to do with this? Just where were they now? Were they still doing well? Why had there been no news since then?
“Little Luo, I would first like to tell you that just because you were born with blank palaces, it does not mean that you’re crippled. In fact, based on what I feel, this is the strongest sort of constitution in this world. You don’t have to feel dispirited at this, and instead rejoice!” Li Taixuan’s words were too earth-shattering, leaving Li Luo speechless.
“Dad… even if you want to console me, couldn’t you do it in a less exaggerated way?” Li Luo lamented. The blank palaces had already hampered his ability to cultivate; just what nonsense was he spouting about some mightiest constitution? Dad, just who are you trying to scam?
Li Taixuan had a wry smile as he explained, “Your natural blank palaces cannot absorb or refine worldly natural energy. This has to do with the root of your power, and frankly… we have no solution for this.” 
“Since it’s a blank palace, then just find some way to stuff something in!” added his mom, with a beaming smile.
Li Luo was now wrinkling his brows in consternation. This was easy to say but impossible to do! Resonances were determined from birth. Wanting to change this after being born was unheard of. He had even experimented with this idea, but to no success.
“In a normal situation, this would truly be undoable. However, ever since we discovered your situation, we have been working hard to find a solution.” 
“If you do your best, you’re bound to succeed eventually! Indeed, the heavens did not disappoint us and we finally found it.” At this point, Li Luo could distinctly hear the thunderous palpitations of the heart, and even his head felt dizzy as blood rushed to his brain in excitement. 
“We poured through numerous ancient records and finally found a solution. This art is known as the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art. It allows one to forge acquired resonances. At the same time, it allows one to integrate their blood essence and soul, along with a chosen resonance, into the forging process. The resulting acquired resonance can then be absorbed into your blank palace.
“Little Luo, your naturally-endowed blank palaces may not necessarily be a bad thing. As natural resonances are too powerful and hard to control, we cannot pass the full art down to you. Instead, the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art is a much better fit for you, allowing you to forge your path as you see fit.
“If you want an elemental resonance, then you can work in that direction. Conversely, if you want a beast resonance, then go ahead and do just that!
“In future, your three blank palaces will contain three carefully constructed resonances. At that point, you will be greatly superior to those with a natural resonance.”
Li Luo’s eyes shone bright like a diamond under light. The situation seemed salvageable. There were all sorts of resonances, and many people had no choice over the manifestation of their resonances. This was something that could not be changed. On the other hand, although he did not have any natural resonances, he had the benefit of flexibility and could essentially determine what sort of resonance he wanted!
“Little Luo, the acquired resonances produced by the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art also have another benefit,” Tan Tailan added.
Although these were just apparitions that were left behind, Li Luo snapped right to attention. Since they had said it was a good thing, then how could he dare to miss this?
“A standard natural resonance is usually only of one element. However, the forged acquired resonances from this art are not the same! They can have two attributes, one main and one supporting.
“These attributes can be fully customizable as you see fit. The power gained is as though giving a tiger wings! I’ve only ever heard of certain natural treasures that have allowed for one’s natural resonance to gain a second minor attribute when taken. However, this effect is miniscule and is just a small additive layer of strength. This is completely different from your acquired resonances, which are forged with two attributes that are supplementary. The difference is worlds apart!
“Oh my gosh, this is just too awesome! Too great!” Li Luo was jubilantly celebrating as he clapped and jumped for joy. He could easily understand the preciousness of this ability. If he chose to forge a fire resonance and then supplemented it with a thunder resonance, the combination of fire and thunder would bring about a multiplicative increase in strength!
At this point, he couldn’t help but become emotional. It looked as though his blank palaces were truly more impressive than those natural resonances!
“Cough. Of course, nothing is ever so perfect. Although your acquired resonances have numerous benefits compared to natural resonances, there is one glaring disadvantage: the forged acquired resonances will not exceed the fourth-grade,” Li Taixuan clarified with a sigh.
Li Luo was momentarily stunned by this revelation. A fourth-grade? This did seem slightly inferior. Compared to Jiang Qing’e’s ninth-grade Light Resonance, there was a difference of more than half the scale!
With such a stark difference in grade, it was very possible that the benefits brought about by the dual elemental resonance would not be able to bridge this gap.
However, his hesitation was short-lived. His current situation was already as bad as it could get, so even a fourth-grade resonance would be considered decent!
Li Luo’s mom spoke dotingly as she reminded him, “Of course, you don’t need to worry. Even though your acquired resonance grade might be low, you can also utilize acquired resonance arts to eventually improve them.” 
Li Luo was once again struck with yet another revelation! That was true indeed. This world contained many wondrous treasures and medicines that allowed one to increase the grade of their resonance. There was a particular profession known as resonance artificer. These people were able to refine and temper spiritual liquids and mysterious treasures that would improve one’s resonance, and as a result, they were widely welcomed by all resonance cultivators.
There were, however, certain constraints to using external means to improve one’s resonance grade. There was usually a limit to the tempering process and, normally speaking, an improvement of a grade or two was the best possible result.
In the case of acquired resonances, as the highest grade was fourth-grade, refinement would lead to a possible peak of fifth or sixth-grade.
“Is Little Luo worried about the physical limitations of refining one’s resonances?” Li Taixuan laughed as though he was reading Li Luo like an open book.  
“Huh?” Seeing his dad’s wide smile, Li Luo’s eyes widened and he couldn’t control himself. Could it be possible that this wasn’t the end? This weakness could still be made whole?
As Li Luo greedily anticipated the next round of news, his mother let out a slight sigh and interrupted his father with a disgruntled expression. “You idiot, you’ve just gone ahead and came clean with everything! Just what can I tell Little Luo now? Huh????”
Li Taixuan’s expression changed as he hastily consoled her, “My dear, I was in the wrong, I was in the wrong! Please explain the rest to our son and I won’t do it again! Please forgive me!”
Upon seeing this familiar sight, Li Luo couldn’t help but shake his head with a sigh. His dad’s survival instincts were truly commendable. Was this something that had been beaten and ingrained into him?
“Brat, are you laughing at your father right now?” That apparition seemed to know exactly how Li Luo would react. Snorting with dissatisfaction, he immediately began to speak in a serious tone. “You are still young and have yet to understand. I am deeeefinitely not afraid of your mother. It’s just that my love for her runs too deep! As I’ve often lectured you, loving your significant other is the most important rule of this family. When you eventually get together with Qing’e, you will also have to obey this law! Do you understand?” When Li Luo heard those words, he couldn’t help but let out a cold laugh. Whenever his father said those words, if not for the fact that this explanation was often accompanied by a sight of a reddened palm mark on his face, he would have almost believed in them!  
Yet when he mentioned Qing’e, Li Luo could only sigh. Qing’e had been intimately raised by his mom and hence their personalities were similar… And he was often on the receiving end of a beating without him having a clue why…
How would his life be in the future??
With a heavy heart full of sadness, Li Luo raised his head and looked at his dad. At this moment, it seemed as though their gazes could transcend time. It was as though he could finally understand what his dad was thinking. For a brief moment, this father and son pair could feel a truly fateful connection with their hearts, one of intimate sorrow…  
“Li. Tai. Xuan. Can you stop standing there and making a fool of yourself? You’re wasting my time!” Li Luo’s mom enunciated with a single raised eyebrow, interrupting that brief moment of endearment between the pair. 
Without surprise, Li Taixuan nodded eagerly, demonstrating that he had heard those words clearly.
At the same time, Tan Tailan turned to look at Li Luo, her tone turning gentle. “The refinement limit is only applicable to natural resonances. This is because these external treasures, no matter how pure and pristine they look, inevitably contain some impurities at their core. It is the accumulation of these impurities that prevent a palace from completely sealing in the resonance’s might. As a result, it makes it difficult to continue refining the resonance past one or two grades.
“However, Little Luo, your blank palaces don’t have this limit. Natural resonances have specific affinities and thus external tempering materials will face some form of rejection from the resonant palaces. Your blank palaces have no affinities, meaning that they can accept anything.
“Thus, your resonances can continually be refined as they will not be rejected by your palaces! Although it will get increasingly difficult to refine your acquired resonances, there is a chance for you to perfect them.
“Hence, it’s as I’ve said. Your blank palaces could very possibly be the world’s mightiest constitution ever! The perceived disadvantages are just a key to greater success.”
Li Luo could feel his heart roiling in waves. He had suffered greatly due to his blank palaces in these past few years. When he had first manifested it, he was unwilling to believe it and even felt angry. His frustrations and furious cultivation still resulted in him remaining powerless. In the end, he could only accept reality as it was.
However, now, with his parents’ words, these blank palaces were not useless. In fact, he might have the world’s best constitution?
This new information brought tears to Li Luo’s eyes.
“Little Luo, for your first acquired resonance, we have already extracted some of your blood essence and a strand of your spirit soul and refined something for you. It is within this crystal ball.
“The Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art is also within,” Tan Tailan explained.
Li Luo could feel a warm current surging through him as he immediately opened his clenched fists. “Dad, Mom, thank you! Let’s go, I’m ready! Transmit this acquired resonance and the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art to me. Let me finally gain the opportunity to be reborn and soar above others!”
At this point, Li Taixuan’s expression became solemn and he became silent for a few breaths before speaking again. “The last thing I want to let you know is that absorbing this acquired resonance is not as easy as you might think it will be.
“As the acquired resonance is assimilated, it will require massive amounts of blood essence. This is why we had to wait until you were seventeen before allowing you to retrieve this. Only at this age will you barely be able to withstand the loss of your blood essence.
“More importantly, what you will lose is not just blood essence, but also part of your longevity. Once this acquired resonance is absorbed, you will only be able to live for five more years… unless you’re able to break into the Duke Stage and transform your body. Otherwise, that will be the end.
“This has been something that your mom and I have disputed for a long time. The price to pay is too great, but you, my boy, have grown up. So we have decided to lay the facts bare and let you make the choice yourself. Little Luo, will you choose to maintain the status quo and become a rich Young Lord? Or will you choose to assimilate with the acquired resonance and cultivate against the heavens, struggling to live while embarking on a path fraught with danger?
“If you choose the first option, then all you have to do is store the crystal ball somewhere and the previous process will revert. If you choose the latter, then reach into the crystal ball. The choice is up to you, but regardless of your decision, the two of us will always support you.” After which, the two apparitions no longer spoke and merely stared at Li Luo with gazes full of concern and love.
Li Luo, on the other hand, gradually eased himself into a sitting position, his eyes focused on the murky, black crystal ball with uncertainty laced within.
Throughout the explanation, he had realized something. Since the benefits were so wondrous, why were there no drawbacks? It seemed that this was left for last.
Now his choices were simple. Did he want to be a weak, little monster? Or a mighty, short-lived beast?


## Chapter 7: Indecisiveness

The room was so silent that one could hear a pin drop.
The black crystal ball was emitting a faint radiance that reflected Li Luo’s unsettled countenance; it was a strange sight.
He was currently embroiled in an impossible choice.
His parents’ hard work had unearthed hope of a new dawn for his blank palaces. However, he had never expected that this hope would come with such a heavy cost.
Li Luo would only have five years left to live.
If in five years he could not enter the Duke Stage and undergo a life-changing metamorphosis, then he would come to an unsatisfactory end.  
Five years to become a Duke?
He was only seventeen now, and in five years he would be twenty-two… [1]
Even after reaching deep into his knowledge, he had never heard of such a young Duke in the history of the Xia Kingdom.
Exactly what sort of culmination of talent, opportunities, and effort would allow one to construct such a miracle?
Li Luo did not know… and hence he could feel a huge sense of pressure envelop him. He even found it hard to breathe. 
The current him could continue to live a mediocre life. His parents had left behind House Luolan, which still possessed a decent amount of businesses. Even if he could not control any of it and gave it all up, he could still live the life of a leisurely Young Lord, free from any worldly worries.
The path of the acquired resonance would place him on the edge, constantly struggling and making every second count. He would have to struggle and wholly strive, squeezing out every last ounce of potential, all to fight against the heavens and to eke out a shred of vitality, all just to barely survive.  
Two wholly different paths—just what should he do?
Li Luo closed his eyes, his heart engulfed in turmoil.
His mind flitted through numerous scenes. He thought of the strange gazes he received from others at the academy. People often liked to say that a tiger had given birth to a dog. How could such illustrious parents give birth to a son with such poor abilities? 
He thought of the person with a pair of pure and beautiful golden pupils. Deep down, he did feel a sense of love and yearning towards Jiang Qing’e, this he did not deny. However, Jiang Qing’e’s exceptionalism was attractive and she had a hoard of other fans. Such an elegant and unparalleled lady could only be matched by a man of heroic and extraordinary temperament. This was only human nature, and there was nothing shameful about it.
When they were young, Li Luo and Jiang Qing’e often competed in all sorts of areas. However, due to all sorts of different reasons, Li Luo lost more than he won. As the two of them grew older, such interactions lessened.
This was especially noticeable after their palaces manifested. Li Luo knew that the gap between the two had only widened, transforming into an uncrossable chasm.
Jiang Qing’e had also begun to reduce their friendly competitions from that point on.
The encounters over the years looked as though they had smoothened Li Luo’s edge over time, as he seemingly became much more mellow. Only he knew that deep down, his desire to win and compete had never diminished, only further stoked ablaze by his apparent weakness.
The reason he was willing to challenge Jiang Qing’e was not simply because he was coerced—he wanted to do so.
In a normal situation, even catching up to Jiang Qing’e, who had already left him in the dust in the cultivation race, was as impossible as surmounting the heavens. However, there was a brief sense of hope now.  
Was he going to give up on this hope?
His real answer was that this was impossible!
Li Luo eyes flashed open, and a trace of sharpness could be seen in his gaze. 
He stared at the apparitions of Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan before saying, “Dad, Mom, I have always had a wild heart. However, those who know of my condition would laugh at me if they heard this, as if I don’t understand my own situation… I’m not only interested in catching up to Sister Qing’e, I want to surpass her! And not just her, I want to surpass the two of you!” A grin hung on his face, displaying his pearly-white teeth. 
“I dream that in the future, people will not recognize me for being Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan’s son. Instead, I want others to see you and know you as Li Luo’s parents!” He chuckled. “Dad, Mom, I am very thankful for this gift you have left for my seventeenth birthday. Rest assured, I will not let you down. All I have to do is reach the Duke Stage in five years. No biggie. I, Li Luo, accept this challenge!”
As he made his final declaration, his eyes lit up with resolve and he no longer hesitated, reaching out with his palm, lightly pressing them onto the black crystall ball. 
Weng!
The black crystal ball responded brilliantly, and Li Luo could feel a piercing pain transmitting through his palms. It was as though countless needles were piercing into him.
At the same time, the black crystal ball began to shatter, and within its interior quietly lay two objects.
One was a black-colored jade slip. As expected, this ought to be the instructions to cultivate the Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art. 
The other item was mysterious-looking. It looked like a liquid and yet seemed to be an illusory item made of flowing light. It was azure in color and seemed to be emitting minute rays of sacred light.
Li Luo’s gaze was affixed onto that illusory liquid object.
He knew that this was something that would change his destiny…. His parents had spent blood, sweat, and tears to refine this acquired resonance.
Additionally, by merely setting his eyes on this strange object, Li Luo could feel a sense of compatibility with it from the depths of his soul.
It was as though this was something that had always belonged to him.
His parents clearly weren’t lying when they said that this acquired resonance was crafted from his own blood essence and spirit soul. The compatibility between man and resonance was instinctive.
“Ah…”  Just as Li Luo was completely enthralled by the mystical acquired resonance, a complicated sigh echoed from behind him. 
Li Luo raised his head and saw that his dad’s apparition had begun to act again. The expression on its face was clearly filled with complications.
“Little Luo, it looks like you’ve made your decision,” Li Taixuan unhurriedly said.
“As your dad, your choice does make me feel a little sad. However, from the perspective of a man, I feel relieved and proud of you. Your future path will undoubtedly be full of danger and peril. But as the son of Li Taixuan, how can these obstacles faze you?” 
His mom’s eyes were also splashed with a tinge of wetness. It seems that when they had left these apparitions behind, they had already predicted this outcome. Perhaps this feeling was also unbearable for her. As a mother, she found it hard to accept that her child would only have five more years of life. 
Yet she did not dissuade him, as she knew that this decision was for Li Luo to make. Furthermore, he had clearly made his decision, so she would do everything she could to support him and believe in him.
“Little Luo, since you have chosen your path, let Mom tell you exactly what sort of acquired resonance we have refined for you.” Hearing his mom’s words, Li Luo perked up.
“Your dad and I experimented with this acquired resonance countless times before finding the most compatible treasures to forge it.
“This is a 4th-grade water resonance supplemented with a light resonance.”
Li Luo was a little shocked before he gave a bitter smile. “Wait… why a water resonance?”
Amongst elemental resonances, there weren’t elements that were better or worse than one another in general. However, there were differences when it came to practical uses. If one was interested in power and penetrating strength, fire, thunder, and metal were definitely the best-in-class. Water resonances were usually more nurturing and defensive in nature; it was a more flexible sort of element.
He had never imagined that his acquired resonance would be one that was more on the side of soft and yielding.
“Haha, Little Luo, you must surely be thinking that a water resonance is soft and weak, something that runs contrary to the strength you wish for in your heart. Don’t underestimate the might of a water resonance. Although they might initially be more feeble in terms of sheer destructive ability, its affinity for vigorous, sustained attacks is unparalleled and will allow you to grind down any other element. If you are able to exhibit the strengths of the water resonance, it will not be any weaker than other elemental resonances.
“Furthermore your water resonance is not a normal one. It also has the power of a light resonance supporting it. If you are able to fully utilize the power of the two, the final result will definitely exceed your imagination!
“Of course, your parents did not just give you a waterlight resonance for no reason. There are two more important reasons for this.
“You will lose a large amount of your blood essence and a large portion of your life during your first absorption of a acquired resonance. It will inevitably bring about grievous injury to you. Water resonances are gentle, and this water resonance’s power will nourish your injured body, allowing you to recover quickly.” It was as though Li Luo had been enlightened. So this was the reason why. In terms of recovery prowess, a waterlight resonance would definitely be top tier in terms of healing.
“Then what’s the second reason?” Li Luo asked curiously within his heart.
Not before long, his dad continued to explain. “The second reason is that we hope you become an amazing resonance artificer, to supplement your future cultivation
“Do you remember the fundamental requirement to become a resonance artificer?” Li Luo paused momentarily. “Being a resonance artificer requires one to either possess a water or light resonance.” 
When it came to cultivation, there were naturally numerous auxiliary professions that arose to support it. A resonance artificer was just one of many. They were able to refine and improve the grade of one’s resonances with the usage of magical treasures.
There were also alchemists; however, those required one to possess a wood or fire resonance.
There were also resonant artifact crafters, those who could craft resonant artifacts used for battle. This required metal, fire, or earth resonances.
resonance artificers and alchemists were similar in many ways. The key difference was that one improved the grade of their resonances, while the other directly increased resonant power.
Water and light resonance cultivators had purifying powers, which was the key reason why they were ideal for becoming resonance artificers.
“But why do I need to become a resonance artificer?” Li Luo was a little unconvinced.
Just as he asked that question, Li Taixuan’s voice once again continued his explanation. “That is because you have a blank palace. You’re able to undergo unlimited refinements of your resonance grades. If you become a resonance artificer, you will gain a deeper understanding of the process and your own palaces, allowing you to strive for perfection.
“Additionally, other resonance artificers either only possess a water or light resonance. Your waterlight resonance power, on the other hand, contains two elements that can mutually support each other. This is unheard of. If you don’t become a resonance artificer, it would be a waste of a heaven-bestowed talent.
“The spirit liquids and purifying lights you produce will clearly outclass any made by any other resonance artificer.”
Tan Tailan then coyly covered her mouth and laughed. “Little Luo, this is a back-up plan that your dad and I have left for you. If House Luolan has been squandered to destitution by you, you’ll at least have a set of skills that will allow you to survive.”
Li Luo’s jaw dropped at his parents’ plan. In the end, he could only shake his head. He was absolutely speechless. He could only say that his parents had planned for every contingency. Even the profession they had in mind for him had been picked to capitalize on his first acquired resonance’s strength.
“However, Little Luo, do keep in mind that this first acquired resonance is just the initial step. Your dad and mom were able to help you refine it with your blood essence and spirit soul. The processes of creating your second and third resonances will be increasingly complicated. You will have only yourself to rely on to discover the route ahead.
“We recommend that you break into the Resonant Master Stage before searching for a way to craft your second acquired resonance. We have left some possible suggestions on the paths you can take for it as well within the jade. Our experiences have also been recorded for your reference.
“The Acquired Resonance Godly Forging Art within this jade will only allow you to craft a second acquired resonance. The complete method to craft the third acquired resonance has been left in Xia City for you to retrieve when the time is right.” 
At this point, Li Luo noticed that the apparitions of his parents seemed to have dimmed a little. This led him to realize that this transmission was finally coming to an end.
“Dad, Mom…” Li Luo couldn’t help but to reach out and grab hold of the light apparitions, only for his hands to pass right through them.
The two continued to look at him with gazes that were full of love and doting compassion.
“Little Luo, it looks like things are about to end…
“Your dad and mom believe that since you have chosen this road, you will definitely succeed in breaking out of this five-year limit.
“We know that you worry for us, but rest assured—before we meet you again, nothing will happen to us.
“Lastly, Little Luo, you must remember that no matter how worried you are, you cannot search for us without reaching the Duke Stage.”
Finally, the apparitions began to flicker and eventually faded into thin air. The entire room was once again subsumed in darkness and silence. 
Li Luo continued to sit in front of the black crystal ball, his eyes watery and red. In the end, no tears fell. He rubbed his eyes and made a commitment. “Dad, Mom… Thank you for giving me everything. Please wait for me. When we meet again, I will definitely shock you and be your source of pride.” 
He gradually composed himself, soothing the turmoil within. After which, he reached out towards the black piece of jade and stashed it away before his eyes landed upon the azure and sacred light-emitting object.
“From today onwards… I will be someone who has manifested a resonance!”
A blazing fervor could be seen within Li Luo’s pupils, along with excitement that had finally reawakened. Without hesitation, he reached out towards the azure acquired resonance.
Weng!
At the moment of contact, he first felt an icy feeling wash through him, followed by an indescribable, acute pain exploding throughout his entire body.
This acute pain intensified and built up, to the point that it completely overwhelmed Li Luo’s consciousness. His vision suddenly turned black and his entire body gradually collapsed onto the ground with a heavy thud.
1. QUIK MAFFS 


## Chapter 8: A New Beginning

Weng!
In the depths of the darkness, Li Luo was shocked awake by the sounds of countless slamming doors. He could faintly make out the shapes and colors of his familiar room as he struggled to open his heavy eyelids with all his might. 
“Huh… this is… what?” 
In an awakened stupor, he began to mumble incoherently. To his terror, he suddenly noticed that his voice was much weaker than it was before. He once possessed the vibrance of spring, but now he seemed to be like an old man with his life candle faint enough to snuff out from a breeze.  
Li Luo struggled to pick himself up from the floor, but even after half a day of struggling, he realized that he didn’t even have an ounce of strength within his limbs.
In the end, all he could do was resign himself to fate and remain lying on the floor for another half a day. Only then did he recover enough strength to stand up and plop himself onto a seat beside him. 
“Young Lord, are you well?” At this point, a female’s voice could be heard. It seemed to be Cai Wei who was asking after him.
Li Luo coughed and replied, “I woke up a little late. What’s up?”
“Qing’e instructed me to inform you that House Luolan’s Council of Nine’s Pavilion Masters are all here and for you to get ready,” Cai Wei’s soft and pleasing voice continued.
“Alright.” Li Luo glanced at a small crack by the window. The light that was coming through was especially resplendent. It was clear that he had laid around for the entire night.
Hearing Li Luo’s reply, Cai Wei felt that things were a little strange. Why did he sound so feeble? Regardless, she moved on and continued with her tasks.
Li Luo then shifted his gaze to where he had placed the black crystal ball the previous night. To his surprise, the black crystal ball had vanished into thin air. There were just a few pieces of ashes remaining on the floor.
It seemed that the black crystal ball had engaged a sort of self-destruct function, completely erasing all traces of its existence.
Following which, he decided to take a glance at the mirror to have a look at himself. However, what he saw caused his expression to change uncontrollably.
The man in the mirror had an alabaster-white complexion. This color would make one assume that all the blood within his body had been sucked away.
What was most noticeable was that his once raven-black hair had turned a mix of grey and white. It was clear that the loss of his blood essence had brought about massive changes to his physiology. 
Li Luo stared blankly at the white-haired youth in the mirror and he spat out his thoughts. “It seems that… I’ve become even more handsome.” Finding joy even in the darkest times, Li Luo continued to muse, “It seems that I’ve lost more than half of the blood essence my body has stored up over the past seventeen years. All to absorb this acquired resonance.” The sudden loss of his blood essence had resulted in a situation where he felt exceptionally weak. Just the act of taking a few steps made him feel dizzy.
On top of that, he could also feel an indescribable emptiness within him. This was not a matter of the heart, but rather the loss of his longevity. 
Li Luo pursed his lips. From this moment on, did he only have five years of life remaining?
This would truly force one to feel the pressure of time ticking.
He exhaled deeply and closed his eyes. It was time to understand his new body.
He could perceive that where there were previously three blank palaces, there was now an azure light being emitted from his first palace. It continuously emitted comfortable and gentle rays of power that were gradually absorbed by this dried-up body of his. 
Li Luo’s mind was solely fixated upon the azure-blue resonant palace. Although he had mentally prepared himself for this sight, actually witnessing it overwhelmed him with emotions. 
The acquired resonance assimilation was a great success!
On this day, his issue of a blank palace had been resolved!
Furthermore, his previously unwanted and troublesome blank palaces had turned into a wondrous opportunity for him.
Opening his eyes, he could feel the worldly natural energy all around him, with two particular types of energy naturally attracted to him.
They were water and light resonance power. 
In the future, he would be able to absorb these two energies for himself, turning them into his own resonant power.
Till then, he would have to cultivate some energy cultivation arts. This was not a huge issue, because House Luolan possessed a strong foundation and hence had stockpiled numerous types.
As Li Luo pondered over his future, he gradually stood up, took a shower, and changed to a clean set of clothes.
After changing, he reassessed himself in the mirror once again. “Hmm, I might be looking a little haggard and with a head of greyish hair… but damn do I look even more handsome and irresistible than before!” Li Luo muttered as he gave a radiant smile.
“Li Luo, your new life awaits you!”
….
Meanwhile, within an old manor in the City of Southwind, although it seemed a little deserted, today’s atmosphere was rare and solemn. Numerous guards were patrolling the premises surrounded by layers upon layers of sentries. 
Within the main hall, the atmosphere was similarly somber. It felt hard to even breathe.
The spacious hall was furnished with two opposing rows of seats. In the middle of those two rows was a pair of seats, one still empty, whilst Jiang Qing’e occupied the other. Her serene gaze was tinged with coldness. 
Her golden pupils indifferently swept across the hall, occasionally flitting towards the row on her left. Within that row was a group of four, all exuding roiling waves of energy.
The strongest aura came from the one sitting at the head of the row. 
He looked to be a youth of around twenty-seven or twenty-eight. His features were ordinary, nothing outstanding. His eyes were deep and his nose was long and narrow. On his right earlobe hung a sword-shaped earring that glowed with a faint, cold light.
His expression at this moment was extremely warm and a smile was on his face, making it easy for people to have a good impression of him.
However, Jiang Qing’e was extremely familiar with the person in front of her. He was not some sort of benevolent individual. In fact, ever since she took control of House Luolan, he was the one responsible for causing her all sorts of impediments.
This was Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan’s disciple in name, an influential figure of House Luolan, Pei Hao.
The three sitting below him were three Pavilion Masters of the Council of Nine. 
Sitting right across their row were the other six Pavilion Masters of the Council of Nine. Out of the six of them, four supported Jiang Qing’e, whereas the last two were neutral, supporting neither party.
One glance at the way the rows were positioned made it abundantly clear just how turbulent the undercurrents of House Luolan had become.
Without the two supporting pillars, Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan, the foundations were easily swayed by the elements and changes…
It had been silent for quite some time, accompanied by the reverberating sounds of tea sipping around the hall.
As though it was prearranged, the head of the left row, Pei Hao, suddenly placed his teacup on the table with nary an extra amount of force. The clear, crystalline ringing of the cup echoed around the hall, immediately causing the peaceful atmosphere of the room to come to a halt.
Pei Hao raised his head and glanced at Jiang Qing’e whilst smiling. “Dear Junior Sister, everyone has been waiting for almost half a day. Why has the Young Lord not arrived?” 
“Even though he is the Young Lord, everyone knows that we are here to decide upon the matters of House Luolan. I have to remind you that when the masters were around, everyone was punctual. This demonstrates his lack of regard for us.” As he spoke, the expressions of the Pavilion Masters of the Council of Nine were varied. Some were unchanging, some frowned slightly, while the rest murmured in a soft tone.
Jiang Qing’e apathetically replied, “Why have I never seen you exhibit so much patience when  the masters were around, then?”
Pei Hao’s eyes narrowed into a line as he smiled. “Apprentice Sister, the future waits for no one, and we have to move forward.” 
Pausing, he stared to look at the rest of the hall before continuing, “Since the Young Lord is late and has not shown himself, I recommend that we proceed and not waste any more time. In any case…” At this point, he had an exasperated smile on his face.
“… we all understand his situation. In fact, it’s probably for the better that he’s not around. Why not let him rest peacefully?” Within the hall was a myriad of different expressions. Other than Jiang Qing’e, no one else had spoken since the beginning.  
“Since no one has any disagreements, let us begin.” Pei Hao continued to smile as he waved his hand, indicating that a decision had been made. 
Jiang Qing’e had an icy countenance at this point, but just as she was about to speak, cacophonous laughter rang from behind the beaded curtain in the room before the hall.
“Senior Pei Hao! It’s been quite a few years since we’ve last met. You seem to have become somewhat… tyrannical! I suppose if my parents knew of how outstanding you have become, they would definitely have appreciated you a little more.” As the laughter rang out, the beaded curtain lifted and a slender and handsome youth strode in with a smirk on his face. 
When everyone in the main hall saw that face, their bodies couldn’t help but to shake involuntarily as everyone reflexively stood up as though conditioned to do so.
That face was exceptionally similar to the one they respected from the depths of their hearts.  
Even Pei Hao’s silly smile had stiffened for a brief moment upon his entrance. His body seemed to have bent slightly, and at the moment he was about to stand, his heart calmed down and he saw him for who he was. 
The person in front of him was not one of the two masters…
This was just a blank-palace cripple!
To regain order, he quickly raised his hand and crushed the teacup in front of him. A crisp and clear sound blanketed the room when the entire teacup turned into dust. 
This seemed to have awakened the nine Pavilion Masters from their stupor, and they quickly composed themselves.
Following which, embarrassment could be seen scrawled all over their faces. The three Pavilion Masters on Pei Hao’s side immediately took their seats.
The remaining six Pavilion Masters hesitated for a brief moment before walking over to offer their respects to Li Luo. 
“Greetings, Young Lord.” As they focused more closely on Li Luo, they noticed that despite him resembling his parents in style, he did not possess the same awe-inspiring momentum. In short, he was still too young and immature. 
Although that illusion of grandeur only happened for a split second, it seemed as though they could no longer remain as calm as before. 
What made them feel the most surprised was Li Luo’s head of grey hair.
Even Jiang Qing’e was astounded by Li Luo’s new hair color as she scrutizined him. This brat was clearly just fine yesterday…
Li Luo reciprocated the greetings to the six and then glanced at the immovable Pei Hao, who was still rooted into his seat.
“Even though it’s only been a few years since we’ve met, it looks like you’ve changed into a completely different person, Senior Pei Hao.” 
Everyone within the hall could understand the implied meaning behind Li Luo’s words, causing the Pavilion Masters’ gazes to light up.
In the past, when Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan were still around, Pei Hao would smile warmly and treat Li Luo gently, like a loving elder brother. He would often even spend time wracking his brains for appropriate gifts for Li Luo.
Unfortunately, no one, not even Li Luo’s parents, could have ever expected that this perennially respectful disciple would suddenly bare his fangs and reveal his true personality in the years they were gone.
Pei Hao replied with that ever-smiling face of his as he observed Li Luo, “It’s been a while! Little Luo seems to have aged quite a bit,”
Following which, he paused and then frowned seriously, “Though why is it that you’ve become so pale and your hair has turned white? It looks like at the rate that you’re going, you barely have much longer to live.”


## Chapter 9: Council Meeting

Pei Hao’s voice resounded throughout the hall, causing the atmosphere to freeze immediately. Who would have expected that this once amiable and friendly man would spout such poisonous and vicious words?
Even though Li Luo’s complexion was indeed pale and sickly, one didn’t have to go so far as to curse that the person was doomed to die, no?
The three Pavilion Masters beside Pei Hao clearly looked awkward in reaction to this chain of events. However, they did not speak and just continued to stare at the floor, as though the tiles were the most fascinating objects in the world.
The other six Pavilion Masters, on the other hand, were clearly enraged.
Peng! Another large shock echoed throughout the room, surprising all. When they looked over, they saw that Jiang Qing’e’s jadelike palm had slammed against the table, an absolutely icy expression on her face.
Yet before Jiang Qing’e could speak, Pei Hao immediately patted his mouth and laughed. “Sorry, sorry! I spoke out of turn and accidentally shot my mouth off. I hope Little Luo won’t fault me for my accidental transgressions.” 
Li Luo glared at Pei Hao as he sized him up before also breaking into a smile. Although he was accustomed to seeing the two-faced reactions of numerous people in the past few years, those were all outsiders. Pei Hao was someone who had been saved by his parents, and it was not an exaggeration to say that he had been given a new lease of life.
Without Li Taixuan and Tan Tailan, Pei Hao would probably have had his four limbs broken by that family he offended and thrown into the sewers before being left for dead. Where would he even have the opportunity to attain all that he had now?
Everything that this Pei Hao had revealed demonstrated a complete lack of gratitude for Li Luo’s parents. On top of that, he even harbored a considerable grudge.
This led Li Luo to sigh. His parents may have been wise and brilliant over the years, but even then, they were human and had made a mistake.
“No worries! This is just your true self leaking out. What is there to be offended about? To be frank, even if I were, what could I do about it? Hence, I won’t say any superfluous words here.” Li Luo shook his head and took his seat in the middle of the two rows.
Pei Hao’s face was full of mirth as he casually spun a thumb ring around his finger. He didn’t seem to have taken any offense or become enraged at Li Luo’s mocking words. There was no need to. It was as Li Luo had said, even if he was offended, what could Li Luo do?
The House Luolan of today was no longer the house of the past.
Without it’s two immovable pillars, there was no one who Pei Hao feared.
A hopeless Young Lord was only useful as a puppet. If not for Jiang Qing’e, he would very possibly have taken control of the entire House Luolan by now.
“Since the Young Lord is here, then I suppose the discussions can begin?” Pei Hao turned to look at Jiang Qing’e.
Jiang Qing’e remained expressionless as she apathetically replied, “Why don’t you start? Why haven’t you contributed even a single piece of skygold from the three pavilions under your control to the house treasuries this year?” 
Pei Hao lightly sighed and replied, “The three pavilions under me are not doing well this year at all. Junior Sister, you might have already heard that all three pavilions have mysteriously burned down! I suspect it is the doings of those external powers that covet our House Luolan’s businesses. I tried my best to investigate the root of the issue, but alas! My investigations turned up with absolutely no result! Hence, I have nothing to contribute this year!”
Li Luo merely listened quietly. Although Pei Hao’s explanation seemed unbelievable and even comical, he did not interrupt. He understood that his words held no weight within House Luolan. The title of Young Lord was merely a superficial title in the eyes of everyone within the house.
Thus, there was no need to speak out and court a rebuff.
Jiang Qing’e gave Pei Hao a deep and firm look before saying, “Is this your reason, Pei Hao?”
Pei Hao casually smirked yet again. “Since Junior Sister wants a reason, then I will just give you a random one! Is there really a need to clarify certain things? Perhaps now that things have come to this, then let me make it clear to Junior Sister and the Young Lord. The three pavilions under me will not be contributing a single piece of skygold this year. In fact, from today onwards, they will not be contributing anything ever again.” Pei Hao’s light tone landed heavily on everyone’s ears. It was as though a peal of thunder had crashed through the room, absolutely shocking all. 
Jiang Qing’e’s body started to exude a cold air and the very atmosphere seemed to have congealed. Her icy tone chilled the hearts of everyone in the room. “So it looks like you plan to defect?” 
Pei Hao grinned before replying, “I could hardly bear to leave House Luolan… It’s just that there isn’t an actual House Lord right now. Who knows what or where this skygold will end up if I pass it over? Perhaps when an appropriate House Lord is finally chosen, I reckon it won’t be too late to submit my tithes.” 
A depressing atmosphere pervaded the hall. The other six Pavilion Masters had ugly looks on their faces. If this was truly the case, then House Luolan would become the joke amongst the Four Great Houses.
This was because Pei Hao had effectively already formed his own feudal army and demonstrated his intent to rebel and divide House Luolan up.
“Pei Hao, do you plan to destroy House Luolan? Do you think you will benefit from its downfall?” a middle-aged man with a deep voice asked. His name was Lei Zhang, and he was a representative that supported Jiang Qing’e.
Pei Hao shook his head. “As I previously said, I don’t wish for House Luolan’s downfall.”
Pausing for a few breaths, he looked over at the silent Li Luo before continuing, “Actually, I want to follow the rules. It’s not impossible for me to contribute my tithes honestly… Of course, I hope that the Young Lord can promise me a single thing in exchange.”  
Li Luo snapped out of his state where he was merely observing with his senses and his heart before affixing his gaze at Pei Hao. Curiously, he asked, “I would like to know what sort of condition Manager Pei Hao has in mind.” 
Pei Hao’s eyes shifted from Li Luo to envelope Jiang Qing’e, taking in the sights of her icy and exquisite demeanor and her slender figure. A trace of fiery greed passed through the depths of his pupils.
“I hope that the Young Lord will annul the engagement with Junior Sister.” After these words were spoken, the temperature within the room seemed to have dropped to absolute zero and everything froze.
Li Luo was not furious, but rather seemed to have turned expressionless. He had often discussed the idea of breaking up the engagement with Jiang Qing’e and had even come up with a promise for the future…
Yet this was something between himself and Jiang Qing’e. The two of them were free to do whatever they wanted or say anything they wished between themselves… It was a personal relationship.
On the other hand, Pei Hao had come up with such a ludicrous idea. Just who did he think he was?
Bang! Just as Li Luo’s heart was turning cold and about to explode forth, a sudden influx of energy exploded outwards within the main hall.
This energy was resplendent and bright, its radiance sweeping across all, bathing the entire hall with light rays.  
Immediately after, Li Luo could indistinctly make out Jiang Qing’e being wreathed in light and shooting outwards, leaving a wondrous afterimage behind.
She headed directly towards where Pei Hao was sitting.
This sudden attack also took Pei Hao by surprise, and so he could only stare. In the blink of an eye, his own body was also wreathed in golden light. 
The sword-shaped earring on his right ear quickly disattached and swiftly, like a storm, transformed into a golden longsword.
Surging golden resonant power coated the longsword, increasing its sharpness. Additionally, an inordinate amount of colorful energy channelled through it, looking like countless rainbows.
Dang!
The collision of metal and gold clashed, resulting in an explosive shockwave of energy. At the same time, all of the furniture within the hall was blasted into pieces. 
The nine Pavilion Masters immediately acted and dissolved the remnant energy, trying to observe the aftermath.
All they could see was two silhouettes locked in a confrontation with swords brandished. Jiang Qing’e against Pei Hao.
Jiang Qing’e was clutching an epee, a sword dripping with resplendent light. The light was bright enough to dazzle the eyes, and if one were to stare at it for too long, they would undoubtedly feel piercing pain in their pupils! 
Who would have expected that this normally refined and pure goddess would be able to produce such shocking amounts of power in the heat of the moment!
She possessed truly tyrannical light resonance power!
On the opposite side of Jiang Qing’e stood Pei Hao, who was wielding a golden longsword. His body was emitting waves of golden resonant power that seemed unusually fierce and even sharp. 
This was metal resonant power.
When the two swords clashed, resonant power exploded outwards, and even the floorboards were cracked to the point that patterns not unlike that of a turtle shell could be seen everywhere.
Pei Hao, still unfazed, maintained a sweet smile. “Ninth-grade Light Resonance. Its fame is well deserved. Junior Sister is just an early stage Earth Fiend, but your resonant power is already so domineering. It’s clearly not inferior to my late stage Earth Fiend resonant power.”
“Your metal resonance seems to have already been raised to the seventh-grade. It looks like you have squandered quite a bit of the tithes meant for House Luolan,” Jiang Qing’e coolly replied. 
Pei Hao used to have a sixth-grade metal resonance, but during this particular clash, Jiang Qing’e could faintly feel that her opponent’s metal resonant power had become even fiercer. Raising a sixth-grade to a seventh-grade would require a significant amount of spirit liquids and purifying lights.
Pei Hao did not reply and instead the two immediately burst out with even more resonant power, their swords savagely colliding for another blow.
Dang!
The energy generated from the clash blew both parties back a few steps.
“How presumptuous of you, Pei Hao!” At this point, Lei Zhang and a few Pavilion Masters appeared behind Jiang Qing’e, their expressions a steely green as they chided. 
At the same time, the other three Pavilion Masters stood behind Pei Hao, their stances clear as they prepared themselves.
The sounds of the battle could be heard from outside the hall. At the same time, chaos was everywhere outside as well. Two waves of horses and men had rushed in, prepared to confront each other.
“Junior Sister, are you planning to let the entire Xia Kingdom know of our internal strife?” Pei Hao gave a wry smile.
Jiang Qing’e’s had an unchanging, cold expression on her face, her gaze emanating waves of killing intent. “Pei Hao, if you don’t wish to die, then swallow those words of yours back into your defiled tummy. No one can interfere in our affairs, you have no right to.” 
Pei Hao mused in silence for a moment as he frowned. “Junior Sister, why are you acting this way? Isn’t that engagement merely a burden for you? I know that you are very thankful towards our masters, but there is no need to be so committed towards Li Luo. He… just isn’t a match for you.”  
“Cruel and unscrupulous dregs like you simply cannot comprehend what gratitude is,” Jiang Qing’e insipidly replied.
Pei Hao shook his head as he stared at Li Luo. “Li Luo, it’s best you smarten up. Otherwise, I will let you know the meaning of getting into trouble for hoarding a treasure! House Luolan is merely just a decoration to you. Junior Sister, on the other hand, is a talented genius and is something you do not deserve to have. Believe me, if you want to imprison her with the gratitude she owes your parents, then you will eventually bring about a catastrophe to yourself.”
Li Luo calmly replied, unfazed by his maddened words, “You’re trying to say that I should let go of both House Luolan and Sister Qing’e?”
“If you’re smart enough, then that is exactly what you ought to do.” Pei Hao nodded before he continued compassionately, “I am doing this for your own good. If you don’t have any power, then you ought to curb your greed. This way, you might still have a way to become a rich and idle man.”
Li Luo smiled and replied, “Pei Hao, aren’t you worried about what will happen to you when my parents eventually return?” 
Pei Hao’s pupils shrank slightly and the expressions of the three Pavilion Masters behind him turned grave. 
In the end, Pei Hao shook his head. “Li Luo, you should not hold on to such sad and naive hopes. Based on what I’ve heard, I’m afraid my masters will no longer be able to return.” As he looked at Li Luo, he gave a sympathetic sigh. 
“Hence, your pillar of support is gone. Are you any different from me when I was powerless? No! In fact, I doubt you could even match up to me at my worst… Even at my worst, when I had no support and was poor and destitute, I still possessed some potential.
“You, on the other hand…. you… have… nothing!”


## Chapter 10: White Eyed Wolf

Pei Hao’s harsh words were just like a sharp blade, cutting straight towards the heart. These words infuriated the Pavilion Masters who were siding with Jiang Qing’e. 
At the same time, they couldn’t help but to look over at Li Luo. What was most surprising was that he seemed to be completely indifferent to those words. This led them to heave sighs of relief and at the same time taste a tinge of regret. This young lord may have been cursed with a blank palace, but his heart was unyielding and firm, something commendable considering his situation.
Pei Hao also noticed that Li Luo was unfazed by his words, making him feel astonished. Perhaps this was not unexpected. Li Luo had changed over these past few years. Perhaps he had already accepted the gravity of the situation. 
“Are you done blabbering?” Li Luo retorted calmly.
Pei Hao returned his reply with a dull smile.
“Actually, I’ve been quite baffled by this series of events. My parents have clearly lavished you with their favor. Why are you acting as though you possess an immense grudge against them?” Li Luo asked.
Pei Hao paused for a moment in thought and replied, “My masters have indeed treated me well. Yet they have always known what I truly wanted: to become a full-fledged disciple. Not just a mere disciple in name. For this goal, I labored for House Luolan endlessly, and what did I get? They never so much as opened their mouths to accept me! Can you understand how many times I’ve anticipated this reward, only to be disappointed?” 
Li Luo laughed. “Is this what it means when one says if you provide too much help in a time of need, the person becomes reliant on you instead? In retrospect, what my parents did was right. With your ungrateful and vicious personality, it would be akin to inviting a blind and vicious wolf into our home. Imagine if you had become an actual legacy disciple… Just what more would you have done? Giving you the position of an actual disciple would only have amplified your wild heart, making it even easier for you to take control of House Luolan.”
Pei Hao shook his head to disagree, unwilling to further quibble with Li Luo regarding that. “It looks like you aren’t interested in my proposition, then?” 
Li Luo shook his head. “Stop wasting your effort. This marriage agreement is something between Sister Qing’e and I. It will not change based on your threats.” 
Hearing his reply, Pei Hao sighed lightly, “Li Luo, greed will only lead to your reckoning. This is no longer the past. You no longer have any capital here.” 
Li Luo’s gaze was affixed on Pei Hao. Despite Li Luo having a much weaker aura compared to Pei Hao, his fervent gaze possessed something that led Pei Hao to feel mildly uncomfortable.
“I will redirect the same words back to you.” As he spoke, Li Luo’s expression became dead-serious.
Pei Hao naturally laughed. “Li Luo, do you really believe that Junior Sister will always be there to protect you? How childish and naive. Since you don’t agree with my suggestions, let’s leave it at that. From now on, it’s as I said. The three pavilions under me will no longer contribute a single tithe to the House. Similarly, any commandments made… will not be implemented… depending on my mood.”
The expressions of the six remaining Pavilion Masters within the hall gradually turned frigid.
Two of the six were still trying to stay neutral. However, if Pei Hao truly wanted to carve apart House Luolan, their interests would also inevitably be affected.
If this was the case, they would unfortunately only be able to obey Jiang Qing’e’s orders and suppress the other three pavilions and Pavilion Masters.
If things were to escalate to that point, House Luolan’s dirty laundry would indeed be aired to the public eye and all of the powers within the Xia Kingdom. 
“What? You wish for me to show my hand?” Pei Hao could feel their cold gazes bearing upon him as he chuckled.
Looking at Pei Hao’s jubilant expression, Lei Zhang and his fellow Pavilion Masters held themselves back in fear of the consequences of aggravating this beast. What was true in Pei Hao’s previous exchange with Li Luo was that his contributions to House Luolan had not been minor. When House Luolan was ascending through the ranks, he had exerted himself greatly, reaping the lives of numerous strong foes. 
Pei Hao had even become a late stage Earth Fiend. Other than Lei Zhang, who was a middle stage Earth Fiend, the rest were only early stage Earth Fiends. 
In this group, perhaps only the ninth-grade Light Resonance-wielding Jiang Qing’e could be his match.
Most importantly, Pei Hao wasn’t just a single individual. He possessed a veritable army and three Pavilion Masters on his end as well.
If all hell were to break loose, it would announce to the world House Luolan’s internal strife and the House’s position within the Xia Kingdom would become even more untenable, to add insult to injury. 
“Everyone, my aim here today is not to engage in meaningless gossip. What I wanted to do was find a solution that would allow House Luolan to continue to stand tall within the Xia Kingdom. 
“If Junior Sister is willing to annul the marriage, then I’m willing to work together to bring House Luolan towards a new era!” Pei Hao’s gaze flitted around the group with his ever-present smile.
“Now that things have come to this, I can only blame a certain Young Lord for being too greedy… It’s time to settle things.” At this point, he produced a medallion. On it was engraved the word “Mo”. This immediately set off a chain of different expressions amongst the group when they realized what it was.
“Is this Elder Mo’s medallion?” Lei Zhang quietly asked.
In House Luolan, other than the nine Pavilion Masters, there were also three respected ancestors holding high positions. They were the mightiest warriors of House Luolan, excluding the two House Lords, and they were all Heavenly Dipper Generals.
Normally, these ancestors would not interfere in the mundane matters of House Luolan, only rising to the occasion when dealing with enemies that brought about existential danger. This was the agreement that Li Taixuan had made with them.
Specifically, Elder Mo was the strongest amongst the trio.
Who would ever have imagined that the one who was most obligated to protect House Luolan would instead pass his authority medallion to Pei Hao. This was a clear indication of his stance. 
“When Master first invited the three ancestors to join, he said that they possessed the power of supervision. Whoever is capable of obtaining the support of two ancestors and four Pavilion Masters by next year’s meeting will have the right to become the House Lord of House Luolan.”
Pei Hao grinned. “Hence, you don’t have to be concerned about me tearing House Luolan apart. What I truly want is the complete whole.”
The entire hall was shocked. No one had expected this turn of events, nor for Pei Hao to raise this possibility.
Judging from the current developments, he did indeed have the possibility to succeed. It was clear that he had long made preparations for the sake of today, taking effect immediately after the House Lords had disappeared.
Pei Hao’s gaze then turned onto the icy Jiang Qing’e and then to Li Luo at the side. “So treasure this remaining year’s worth of time. You might no longer have any affiliation to House Luolan after the next housemeet. At that point, you will truly have nothing!” After delivering his ultimatum, Pei Hao turned and strode away, the three Pavilion Masters in tow.
With Pei Hao’s departure, the frigid atmosphere previously found in the hall gradually warmed up. Yet the countenances of the ones remaining were tinged with sadness.
Although they had made certain preparations for the housemeet, when push came to shove, it had still caused quite a headache.
What was commendable was Jiang Qing’e being able to remain cool and collected the entire time. She immediately reassured the six Pavilion Masters and delegated some important matters before letting them go.
After which, silence descended upon the hall again.
Li Luo’s eyes were fixated upon the floorboards until his view was filled by a pair of straight and slender jade-like legs. Only then did he snap back to reality and raise his head to look at the person in front of him. His gaze met Jiang Qing’e’s, quietly watching him with her alluring, golden pupils. 
“Even though you seem to be calm on the outside, you must be seething on the inside, huh?” Jiang Qing’e casually asked.
Li Luo gave a bitter smile. “How can I not be angry?” Pei Hao had treated him as though he was non-existent. Combined with the request to annul the marriage in front of the House, it was akin to being stomped in the face.
“However, your performance was admirable. You never lost your cool.” Jiang Qing’e’s dainty, red lips rose into a slight smile as she praised him.
“If only I was strong enough. I would have smashed him to a pulp on the spot and assisted my parents with some housekeeping matters…” Li Luo sighed. Staying calm? Wasn’t this because he could do nothing else?
At this point in time, Li Luo gained a greater appreciation for the importance of personal strength. The Young Lord without his parents was worth nothing at all.
He did realize that what was most important now were his blank palaces. Everyone thought that he was powerless and hence underestimated him.
“No one will ever have a smooth life. Exercising forbearance is a virtue,” Jiang Qing’e explained.
Li Luo nodded in agreement. “After experiencing today’s housemeet, I now understand just how much trouble House Luolan is in. These two years must have been hard on you, Sister Qing’e.” House Luolan’s ascent to the top had been too rapid and a solid foundation had not been laid, resulting in the situation seen today. The moment the founders disappeared, the tower they had built was no longer stable. 
If not for Jiang Qing’e’s two years of blood, sweat, and tears, perhaps the predators looking to tear the place apart would not only just be Pei Hao.
Jiang Qing’e took a seat as she elegantly folded her alluring, white, and slender legs together. “Don’t take what Pei Hao said to heart. I will deal with him. All I need is a little bit of time.” After saying this, killing intent could be seen emanating from her pure-gold pupils. 
“Since the two of us already had an agreement, then I will naturally carry it out. I will hand House Luolan to you in one complete piece. Thus, don’t take to mind the problems faced by House Luolan today. What you need to focus on is Southwind Academy’s final examination happening next month. If you are able to enter the Astral Sage College, all these problems will naturally resolve themselves,” Jiang Qing’e gently said.
At this point, she paused and tilted her head slightly and smirked. “Of course, if you feel that your chances aren’t too good, just let me know. I can treat your agreement as something you said at the spur of the moment and won’t hold it against you.” 
Li Luo blinked before extending his hand. “Pass me your hand.” 
Slightly suspicious, she inspected the hand in front of her and paused for a moment. If it were some random stranger who had asked this of her, they would most definitely get a sword chopping towards them in return. Li Luo, on the other hand… they did have a special relationship after all.
Hence, she expressionlessly extended her own dainty hand, placing it within Li Luo’s palm.
Li Luo tightly grasped her small hand, that delicate feeling causing one’s heart to sway. Perhaps it was due to her light resonance that her skin was an exceptionally sparkling snow-white, like the most beautiful of jade, the downfall of a kingdom.
However, Li Luo suppressed his urges to fondle her hand gently, instead circulating a tiny amount of resonant power to be emitted from the palm of his hand. 
The previously calm Jiang Qing’e’s expression changed swiftly when she felt that weak amount of resonant power come forth.
Grasping Li Luo’s palm tightly with her slender fingers, she directed her consciousness towards Li Luo’s body. It was then that she discovered that Li Luo’s previously blank palace was now emanating an azure radiance!
Jiang Qing’e was a little shocked at Li Luo’s smug look. “This… is a water resonance? You’ve manifested a resonance?” Her mind in shock, she only released her grip gradually after a long while. “Is this what the Masters left behind for you?” Li Luo nodded. 
Jiang Qing’e exhaled lightly before speaking. “This seems to be the best piece of news all day! Although your water resonance is not of a high grade, it seems to have an unmatched sort of purity to it. Perhaps this is because the Masters utilized treasures from the heavens and earth to craft it. Regardless, this is still an excellent beginning.” It was clear from Jiang Qing’e’s facial expression that her mood had improved. Even her slender eyebrows were no longer furrowed in thought.  
She even joked, “Congratulations! Eh? It looks like you’ve finally made it a tiny step closer towards annulling the marriage agreement!”
But she was faced with a serious question now. “Do you think his words about my parents were true?” Li Luo smiled helplessly.
Jiang Qing’e’s long eyelashes gently fluttered as she blinked. “Although I don’t know where he got his sources from, I personally feel that with how shortsighted he is, how could he possibly comprehend how mighty the Masters are? Furthermore, I believe that the two of them have only been restrained temporarily. They are definitely fine and free of harm.” Li Luo gradually nodded vigorously in agreement.
“I feel the same way too.” 
Jiang Qing’e stood up and walked to the window. At this point, the sun’s rays bathed her exquisite body with resplendence, each ray tracing her every movement, a truly soul-stirring sight. 
“I will return to Xia City tomorrow. If you need me for anything, let Cai Wei know. She will remain in the Tianshu Province for a while, helping to tidy up House Luolan’s affairs” 
After settling a few more matters, Jiang Qing’e turned to look at Li Luo. The sun had yet to set, and its light shrouded her perfect silhouette.
Those golden pupils looked even more radiant with such a background, an eye-catching and unforgettable sight. 
“And so, Li Luo…. I hope that the next time I see you, you’ll already be part of the Astral Sage College,” Jiang Qing’e, with that ever-beautiful smile on her face, quietly murmured to herself.
